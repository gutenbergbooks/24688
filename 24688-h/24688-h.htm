<h2 class="hd3">PART I</h2>

<h2>ORGANIZATION AND WORK</h2>

<h3>History</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Manhattan Trade School for Girls began its
work in November, 1902. The building selected for
the school was a large private house at 233 West 14th
Street, which was equipped like a factory and could
comfortably accommodate 100 pupils. Training was
offered in a variety of satisfactory trades which required
the expert use of the needle, the paste brush, and the
foot and electric power sewing machines.</p>

<p>Beginning with twenty pupils on its first day, it was
but a few months before the full 100 were on roll and
others were applying. In endeavoring to help all who
desired instruction the building was soon overcrowded.
It thus became evident that, unless increased accommodation
was provided, the number already in attendance
must be decreased and others, anxious for the training,
must be turned away. It was decided that even though
the enterprise was young the need was urgent, demanding
unusual exertion. It would therefore be wise to
make every effort to purchase more commodious quarters.
In June, 1906, the school moved to a fine business building<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
at 209-213 East 23d Street, which could offer daily
instruction to about 500 girls.</p>

<p>The movement owes its existence to the earnest study
that a group of women and men, interested in philanthropic,
sociological, economic, and educational work,
gave to the condition of the working girl in New York
City. They were all intimately acquainted with the difficulties
of the situation. Early in the winter of 1902
this committee made a special investigation of the workrooms
of New York. They were but the more convinced
that (1) the wages of unskilled labor are declining;
(2) while there is a good opportunity for highly skilled
labor, the supply is inadequate; (3) the condition of the
young, inexpert working girl must be ameliorated by
the speedy opening of a trade school for those who have
reached the age to obtain working papers; (4) if public
instruction could not immediately undertake the organization
of such a school, then private initiative must do
it, even though it must depend for its support upon
voluntary contributions. The result was that an extreme
effort was put forth and the following November the
first trade school in America, for girls of fourteen years
of age, was begun.</p>

<p>The first Board of Administrators, composed largely
of members of the original committee of investigators,
was as follows:</p>

<p>President, Miss Virginia Potter; Vice-Presidents,
Dr. Felix Adler, Mr. John Graham Brooks, Mrs. Theodore
Hellman, Mrs. Anna Garlin Spencer, Mrs. Henry
Ollesheimer; Treasurer, Mr. J. G. Phelps Stokes; Secretary,
Mr. John L. Eliot; Assistant Secretary, Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Louise B. Lockwood; Director, Professor Mary Schenck
Woolman.</p>

<h3>Purpose and Scope</h3>

<p>The immediate purpose of the school was to train
the youngest and poorest wage-earners to be self-supporting
as quickly as possible. It was decided to help the
industrial workers rather than the commercial and professional,
as the last two are already to some extent
provided for in education. The function of the school
was, therefore, that of the Short-Time Trade School,
which would provide the girl who must go to work the
moment she can obtain her working papers (about fourteen
years of age) with an enlightened apprenticeship
in some productive occupation. Such training cannot be
obtained satisfactorily in the market. The immature
workers are present there in such large numbers that
they complicate the industrial problem by their poverty
and inability, and thus tend to lower the wage. Jane
Addams, of Hull House, Chicago, says these untrained
girls "enter industry at its most painful point, where
the trades are already so overcrowded and subdivided
that there remains in them very little education for the
worker." The school purposed to give its help at this
very point.</p>

<p>Trade, on its side, is eager to have skilled women
directly fitted for its workrooms, but finds them hard to
obtain. The school's duty was to discover the way
to meet this wish of the employers of labor. It is true
that the utilitarian and industrial education offered by
public and private instruction has benefited the home<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and society, but such training has not met the problem
of adequately fitting for specific employments the young
worker who has but a few months to spare. The lack
in this instruction has been in specific trade application
and flexibility as to method, artistic needs, and mechanical
devices. These points are essential to place the girl
in immediate touch with her workroom.</p>

<p>Therefore the Manhattan Trade School assumed the
responsibility of providing an economic instruction in
the practical work of various trades, thus supplying them
with capable assistants. Hence its purpose differed not
only from the more general instruction of the usual
technical institution, but also from those schools which
offered specific training in one trade (such as dressmaking),
in that it (1) offered help to the youngest
wage-earners, (2) gave the choice among many trades,
and (3) held the firm conviction that the adequate
preparation of successful workers requires more factors
of instruction than the training for skill alone. The
ideals of the school were the following: (1) to train a
girl that she may become self-supporting; (2) to furnish
a training which shall enable the worker to shift from
one occupation to another allied occupation, <i>i. e.</i>, elasticity;
(3) to train a girl to understand her relation to
her employer, to her fellow-worker, and to her product;
(4) to train a girl to value health and to know how to
keep and improve it; (5) to train a girl to utilize her
former education in such necessary business processes
as belong to her workroom; (6) to develop a better
woman while making a successful worker; (7) to teach
the community at large how best to accomplish such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
training, <i>i. e.</i>, to serve as a model whose advice and help
would facilitate the founding of the best kind of schools
for the lowest rank of women workers.</p>

<p>In other words, the Manhattan Trade School aimed
to find a way (1) to improve the worker, physically,
mentally, morally, and financially; (2) to better the conditions
of labor in the workroom; (3) to raise the
character of the industries and the conditions of the
homes, and (4) to show that such education could be
practically undertaken by public instruction. The four
aims are really one, for the better workers should
improve the product, make higher wages, react advantageously
on the industrial situation and on the home,
and the course of instruction formulated to accomplish
this end would help in the further introduction of such
training.</p>

<p>It was not expected that immature girls of fourteen
or fifteen years of age would, immediately on entering
the market, make large salaries or be broad-minded
citizens. The hope was to give them a foundation which
would enable them to adapt themselves to situations best
fitted to their abilities and to make possible a steady
advance toward better occupations, wages, and living.
In order to do this, each girl on entering the school must
be regarded as having capacity for some special occupation.
This aptitude must be discovered that she may
be placed where she can attain her highest efficiency as
rapidly as possible. She must be treated individually,
not as one of a class. Her own efforts must be
awakened, her handicaps, such as inadequate health
and unadaptable education, must be removed, and her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
training proceed in a way to give her possession of
her powers.</p>

<h3>Conditions among the Workers</h3>

<p>The conditions of life among many of the wage-earners
of New York City are, briefly stated, as follows:
Thousands of families are so poor that the children
must go to work the moment the compulsory school
years are over. In 1897, 14,900 boys and girls dropped
from the fifth school grade, most of them going to work
from necessity more or less pressing. To rise to important
positions in factories, workrooms, or department
stores will require a practical combination of any needed
craft with the ability to utilize their school education in
rapid deductions, business letters, accounts, and trade
transactions. The public school offers such children a
general education which will be completed in the eighth
grade, but the majority leave before that time. For
varying reasons, such as their foreign birth, irregular
attendance, the impossibility of much personal attention
in the crowded classes of a great city, poor conditions of
health, and the desire of the pupils to escape the routine
of school as soon as the law will allow, the greater
number of them, who go early into trade, have not had
a satisfactory education for helping them in their working
life. Year after year are they found wanting, and
yet young workers still come from the schools at fourteen
with poor health, little available hand skill, unprepared
to write business letters or to express themselves clearly
either by tongue or pen, uninterested in the daily news
except in personal or tragic events, unaware of municipal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
conditions affecting them, ignorant of the simple terms
of business life, and with their arithmetic unavailable
for use, even in the simple fundamental processes when
complicated with details of trade. The mechanical processes,
therefore, which they do know are now useless
unless they can first think out the problem.</p>

<p>These boys and girls have no regret at leaving the
schools, and are, as a rule, glad to get to work. The
tragedy of life, however, begins when they become wage-earners,
for they are only fitted for unskilled and poorly
paid positions. A little fourteen-year-old girl finds it
difficult to obtain a satisfactory occupation in the teeming
workrooms of New York. She, or some member of her
family, eagerly searches the advertising sheet of one of
the daily papers. Most of the "Wants" are entirely
beyond her crude powers to supply. An unskilled worker
is perhaps desired in some business house, but the applicant
finds that hundreds of other girls are flocking to
obtain the same position, and her chance is too remote
for hope. Or perhaps, after weary days of wandering
about from place to place, she is recommended to the
boss of some shop, and finds herself in the midst of
machines which rush forward at 4,000 or more stitches
a minute. She assists a busy worker on men's shirts,
her duty being to pin parts together, to finish off, or to
run errands. From early morning to late afternoon,
with an interval for lunch, she must be ready to lend a
hand. She can get at best but $2.50 or $3.00 per week.
No rise is possible in this shop unless she can work
well on a machine. Her fellow-workers are too busy
to teach her, for each moment's pause means reduction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in their little wage. Perhaps she does persist and finally
can control a machine. By learning to do one thing
rapidly she can obtain a better wage, but two or even
more years in trade often pass before she can earn five
dollars a week. After several seasons spent in doing
the same process thousands of times, her desire for new
work becomes deadened, and she is afraid to attempt
anything different from her one set task. She usually
refuses to try more advanced work, even if offered a
good salary while she is learning, for she has lost her
ability to push ahead.</p>

<p>In general, it may be said that the untrained girl has
to take the best place she can find, without reference to
her ability, her physical condition, or her inclination.
The most desirable trades are seldom open to her, for
they require workers of experience, or, at least, those
who have had recognized instruction. Even if a green
girl enters a skilled trade, she cannot rise easily in it,
and is apt to be dropped out at the first slack season.
The sort of positions open to her have usually little
future, as they are isolated occupations that do not lead
to more advanced work. Illustrations of these employments
are wrapping braid, sorting silk, running errands,
tying fringe, taking out and putting in buttons in a
laundry, dipping candy, assorting lamps, making cigarettes,
tending a machine, and tying up packages. These
young, unskilled girls wander from one of these occupations
to another; their salaries, never running high,
rise and fall according to the need felt for the worker,
and not because her increasing ability is a factor in her
trade life. After several years spent in the market, she
is little better off than at her entrance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<h3>Some Difficulties of Organization</h3>

<p>It was to relieve this serious situation that the
Manhattan Trade School was founded. It began its
work in the face of great discouragements. Employers
were prejudiced against such instruction, for girls trained
in former technical schools had not given satisfaction
in the workrooms. The parents of the pupils felt that
they could not sacrifice themselves further than the end
of the compulsory school years, but must then send their
children into wage-earning positions. It was impossible
to obtain state or municipal aid, and it was known that
the experiment must be costly, for: (1) A trade school
must be open all the year for day classes, and for night
work when needed (schools usually are open from eight
to ten months). (2) The work must be done on correct
materials, which are often expensive and perishable; but
pupils are too poor to provide them, therefore the school
must plan to do so. (3) The supervisors must be well
educated, with a broad-minded view of industry, capable
of original thought, and having a practical knowledge of
trade requirement (women of such caliber can always
command the best salaries). The teachers and forewomen
also must combine teaching ability with competence
in their workrooms; but as the market wishes a
similar class of service and gives excellent wages to
obtain it, the school must offer a like or even a larger
amount. (4) Teachers of highly skilled industries are
expert, usually, in but the one occupation, such as straw
hat making by electric machine or jewelry box making;
consequently, even if the student body is small, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
teaching force can seldom be reduced without cutting
off an entire department or a trade. A trade school
differs from the high school in this particular, for in the
latter, when necessary, two or more academic subjects
can be taught by the same instructor.</p>

<p>Another difficulty confronting the school at the beginning
was, that while numerous occupations in New
York are open to women, there was reason to think
that some of these were not well adapted to them. Little
was known at that time of the trades offering opportunities
for good wages, steady rise to better positions,
satisfactory sanitary conditions, and moderate hours of
labor; of the physical effect of many of the popular
occupations; of the specific requirements of each kind
of employment; of the effect of the working girls in their
workrooms and in their homes; of their health and how
to improve it; of the needs and wishes of the employers;
of the relation of the Trade Union to trade instruction,
and of labor legislation already operative or which should
be furthered. Before deciding on courses of instruction
in the Manhattan Trade School some accurate knowledge
of these facts had to be obtained.</p>

<h3>Selection of Trades</h3>

<p>The selection of definite trades was made after five
months of investigation in the factories, workrooms, and
department stores of New York City. In general, it
can be said of the occupations chosen that they employ
large numbers of women; require expert workers; training
for them is difficult to obtain; there is chance within
them for rise to better positions; the wages are good,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and favorable conditions, both physical and moral, prevail
in the workrooms. Some trades employing women
were rejected, as they failed to meet necessary requirements,
while others were not chosen, as there was little
chance in them to rise on account of men's trades intervening.
Slack seasons occurring in many otherwise good
employments were considered, and plans were made
whereby the worker could be enabled to shift to another
allied trade when her own was slack. If a girl gains
complete control of her tool she can adapt herself to
other occupations in which it is used with less difficulty
than she can change to a trade requiring another tool.
Women's industries, to a great extent, center around the
skilled use of a few tools. These tools were selected as
centers of the school activities, and the connected trades
were radiated from them. The most skilled occupations
were found to require the use of the sewing machine,
foot and electric power, the paint brush, the paste brush,
and the needle. Statistics show that teaching the use of
this last tool will affect over one-half of the women
wage-earners of New York, of whom there are at least
370,000. In addition to the general scheme of fitting a
worker so that she may take up another allied occupation
in slack seasons, specific training for this purpose is
given to those students who choose trades where the busy
season is short and of frequent recurrence.</p>

<h3>Trade Courses</h3>

<p>The curriculum includes instruction in the following
trades; the courses are short and the teaching is in trade
lines:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p class="bk1">I. Use of electric power sewing machines.</p>

<div class="bk2"><p>1. General Operating&mdash;(cheaper variety of work&mdash;seasonal;
fair wages. Better grade of work&mdash;year
round, fair and good wages, piece or week work):
Shirtwaists, children's dresses (cloth and cotton),
boys' waists, infants' wear, children's clothing,
women's underwear, fancy petticoats, kimonos and
dressing sacques.</p>

<p>2. Special Machines&mdash;(seasonal to year round work,
depending on kind and demand, wages good):
Lace stitch, hemstitching, buttonhole, embroidery
(hand and Bonnaz), and scalloping.</p>

<p>3. Dressmaking Operating&mdash;(year round, wages
good): Lingerie, fancy waists and suits.</p>

<p>4. Straw Sewing&mdash;(excellent wages for a short
season, but the worker can then return to good
wages in general operating): Women's and men's
hats.</p></div>

<p class="bk1">II. Use of the needle and foot power sewing machines.</p>

<div class="bk2"><p>1. Dress and Garment Making&mdash;(seasons nine to
eleven months, and fair to good wages): Uniforms
and aprons, white work and simple white embroidery,
gymnasium and swimming suits (wholesale
and custom), lingerie, dress embroidery, dressmaking
(plain and fancy).</p>

<p>2. Millinery&mdash;(short seasonal work, low wages, difficult
for the average young worker to rise): Trimmings
and frame making.</p>

<p>3. Lampshade and Candleshade Making&mdash;(seasonal
work, fair pay). This trade supplements the
Millinery.</p></div>

<div class="bk1"><p>III. Use of paste and glue: 1. Sample mounting (virtually
year work, fair wages). 2. Sample book<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
covers, labeling, tissue paper novelties and decorations
(seasonal and year round work, good wages).
3. Novelty work (year round work, changed within
workroom to meet demand, wages good). 4. Jewelry
and silverware case making (year round work,
wages good).</p>

<p>IV. Use of brush and pencil (year round work, good
wages): Special elementary art trades, perforating
and stamping, costume sketching, photograph and
slide retouching.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i> Year round work, in general, includes a holiday
of longer or shorter duration, usually without pay.</p></div>

<h3>Entrance Plans</h3>

<p>The school is open throughout the year in order to
train girls whenever they come&mdash;the summer months
being slack in most trades are especially desirable for
instruction. The tuition is free, and in cases of extreme
necessity a committee gives Students' Aid, in proportion
to the need. Entrance to day classes for girls who are
from fourteen to seventeen years of age and who can
show their working papers or be able to produce documentary
evidence of age, if under sixteen, can occur
any week.</p>

<p>Each girl who enters, after selecting her trade, is
given a typewritten paper showing the possible steps
of advance in her chosen course. She takes this home
in order that the family may know what is before her.
She can by special effort or by outside study lessen the
length of her training. The first month in the school
is a test time. If the girl shows the needed qualities
she is allowed to continue.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>During the month of trial her instructors decide
what she needs and if her chosen trade is the best for
her. The right is reserved to make a complete change
if her health will not stand the one she desires, if she
has no ability for it, or if she gives evidence of special
talent in another direction.</p>

<h3>Industrial Intelligence</h3>

<p>Every student has, as a part of her trade education,
such academic work, art, and physical training as seems
necessary; when she passes certain standards she is then
allowed to devote full time to her selected occupation.
It is not possible for a worker who has skill with the
hand and no education to back it up to rise far in her
trade. There is many a tragedy in the market of the
woman whose poor early education prevented her from
getting ahead. Accurate expression, whether oral or
written, the use of arithmetic in simple trade transactions
or detailed accounts, the ability to grasp the important
factors in any situation and then to go to work without
waste of time or motion, are required for positions of
trust and for supervision in any workroom. It was
soon discovered that the girls entering the school know
arithmetic in an abstract way, but are at sea when asked
to meet the ordinary trade problems. They are inaccurate
in reading and copying; they cannot write a letter
of application, conduct correspondence, make out checks,
or keep simple accounts. They are ignorant of the laws
already made which concern them and of their own relation
to future laws. They have no ideals in their trade
life. They need to see the relation of their chosen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
trade to the country, of their work to their employer's
success, the effect they may have in bringing about a
better feeling between the employer and the wage-earner.
A practical, immediately available business education is
absolutely essential to make workwomen of executive
ability. Therefore specific trade instruction in arithmetic,
English, history, geography, and civics was
planned to supplement and enrich the trade courses.</p>

<p>Steady progress has been made in determining the
kind of cultural trade instruction which will best assist
such young wage-earners. A new field in practical education
had to be opened, and subject matter which could
be of service in the workrooms selected from it. The
many trades of the school had to be studied in order to
know their needs. The work has grown more valuable
each year and has proved itself to be a truly necessary
part of the curriculum. A concrete evidence of its worth
is the fact that many of the girls in slack seasons have
taken clerical positions and have been complimented on
their grasp of the subject, their orderliness, their ability
to think, and their reliability. Naturally all departments
unite to develop character in the students, but the
Academic Department feels this to be a special aim.
Pleasure in the subject of instruction, followed by mental
and moral improvement, has indicated clearly that the
academic dullness which is shown at entrance comes frequently
from lack of motive in former studies. The
interest is all the more encouraging as there are many
handicaps in the teaching, for the students enter at any
time, are graded by the trades they select, and are placed
in the market as quickly as possible; hence the work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
cannot be uniform in its advance. Nor is the academic
work a help to the girls in their business life only, for
such subjects as the keeping of accounts, the consideration
of the cost of living, and the value and price of
materials are of direct use also in home life.</p>

<h3>Trade Art Instruction</h3>

<p>Courses in Trade Art were also organized as a
fundamental part of the instruction. Each trade has
its own art, and the school has tried to adapt the work
in the studios to each different occupation. It recognizes
that the art applied in dressmaking differs from
that in millinery, and this again from that required for
decorating jewelry boxes and calendars. It consequently
offers each student the kind of elementary art training
needed in her trade. The time is too short to develop
designers, but it does help a girl to be more exact,
resourceful, and useful in her workroom, and often
enables her to make a higher wage. A worker who
can place trimming, adapt designs to new purposes,
stamp patterns, draw copies of garments, and combine
color attractively is especially desirable in her chosen
employment.</p>

<h3>Health</h3>

<p>The young wage-earner of New York is much handicapped
by her poor physical condition; heredity, poor
habits of life, and unsanitary homes show their effects
upon her. The girls who come to the school are young
enough to remedy many of their defects. In a few
months they will be in positions demanding eight or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
more hours a day, in which they must strain every
nerve and bend all of their energies to meet the standard
brought about by trade competition. The Physical Department
of the school studies the health of each girl
and trains her to care adequately for it. The specific
treatment needed by some of the students takes them
many hours a week from their department work. While
this has its disadvantages, it is felt to be more important
to improve the physical condition than to develop skill
alone when the health is too poor to stand the strain of
exacting positions. It is often difficult at first to persuade
parents that such close attention to health is
necessary. The results, however, in the majority of
cases have proved the wisdom of this procedure.</p>

<p>Immediately after entering the school and being
assigned to a department each girl must report to the
school physician. Beginning with the family history, a
complete record of all the important events relating to
her physical life is taken. She is closely questioned
as to all bodily functions, and a careful record is kept
of irregularities. Eyes, ears, teeth, nose, throat, and
feet are likewise examined, and measurements are taken
of height, weight, and the principal expansions. After
the examination, instruction as to treatment is given,
if any is needed.</p>

<p>The work in the gymnasium has three purposes:
invigorative, reactive, and corrective. Every girl who
is not restricted on account of physical defects takes the
prescribed gymnastic work. Nor has this a physical
effect only, for through the active games such qualities
as judgment and accuracy, self-control, and the harmonious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
working with others are developed. Slow, uncertain,
vague movements denote lack of mental quickness
and strength. Motor activity, rightly directed, leads
to poise of mind as well as of body. These girls live
mostly in crowded localities of the city, where free
exercise is unknown. The school aims, as far as possible,
to supply the lack of wholesome outdoor life and
give joyous active exercise. Talks on hygiene are a
regular part of the work and aim: (1) to give each
girl a knowledge of her body and of its functions
which will enable her to care for her health in an intelligent
manner; (2) to show her the relation of food
and its preparation to her physical condition; (3) to
establish in her mind ideals of correct living which
can be made practical in her surroundings; and (4),
recognizing the right and desire of every girl for amusement,
to create a love for wholesome and simple pleasures
that will take the place of the too strenuous and
often unwise recreations which tend to undermine the
health of the girl who works.</p>

<h3>The Lunchroom and the Cooking Classes</h3>

<p>From the opening of the school, hot soup, hot chocolate,
or cold milk had been served daily, at two cents
a cup, to those wishing to supplement the cold lunch
which they had brought from their homes. The teachers
also had an opportunity of buying a simple, hot meal
which was prepared by one of their number, assisted
by students who aided in the preparation, serving, and
clearing away. At first the average girl felt she could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not give much time to her trade training, consequently
such time had to be devoted to making her able to
command a living wage. The hope, however, that in the
future the opportunity would come for offering increased
domestic training was never forgotten. The opening
at the school of a temporary workroom for unemployed
women during the financial stress of 1908 provided them
with regular work and pay. It was advisable also to
serve nourishing lunches daily to these underfed workers.
There was already a simple lunchroom in the basement
of the school, containing such bare necessities as plain
tables on horses, long wooden benches, a gas stove with
four burners, a few cooking utensils, and a closet filled
with inexpensive china. The complete cost of equipment
had been $300.</p>

<p>The school was now, however, face to face with the
need to feed daily more than 500 people&mdash;teachers,
workers, and students&mdash;and yet no additional money
could be spent for equipment. The necessity was so
great, however, that in addition to the usual lunches a
hot, nourishing meal was given daily to the hundred
workers in the temporary workroom, for which they
paid one-half of the price of materials.</p>

<p>With this inauguration of regular cooking it seemed
especially desirable to take the opportunity of training
at least some of the students in the selection, care, and
preparation of food. The majority of these girls will
be the mothers of the next generation, and yet they
know nothing of food values or food preparation. This
is evident from the daily lunches they bring and from
their discussions in the class on hygiene. On the other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
hand, girls who can remain but a few months in the
school have a serious need to face, that of self-support,
for the wage for unskilled girls ($3.00) is not sufficient
to live on with decency. The physical, mental, and moral
future of these young girls demands that they should
be able to make more than this pittance. In the few
months during which the majority are in attendance both
a trade training and a knowledge of cooking cannot be
given, therefore the former must take the precedence.
The school has been able to prove, however, that girls
educated there can command a fair wage in trade, but
that a longer time given to this training will enable
them to obtain better positions and salaries. Hence an
increasing number have been willing to remain longer,
giving even a year or more to preparation. It was with
this latter class that the time was ripe to offer some
training in lunchroom cookery which could teach them
what could be procured at low prices and yet be nourishing;
how to prepare food at home, and how to use the
hot table often found in an up-to-date factory. For this
purpose, therefore, some simple additional equipment
was installed and a daily menu was offered, comprising
inexpensive, attractive, wholesome dishes, at the lowest
possible cost. Many of the students care for so little
variety in food that all of the necessary elements for
building strong, healthy bodies are not supplied, hence
they are under-nourished. They require encouragement
to even try the food which is essential for improving
their physical condition. The girls have taken great
interest in their lunchroom cookery. They appreciate
the inexpensive menus and admire the simple table decorations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Gradually they have given up spending their
few pennies for poor fruit, cake, or candy at some cheap
shop, and now purchase nourishing dishes cooked by the
students at the school.</p>

<p>The cooking course connects directly with the talks on
hygiene. The plan of work is the following: (1) Twenty
girls are chosen at one time. These work in two groups
of ten each, and for six weeks have daily one-hour
lessons. This gives them thirty lessons, which is almost
equivalent to what the public school offers in a year,
but, being concentrated into daily work and practical
use in the lunchroom, is of equal, if not greater, efficacy.
(2) The students set the tables, cook a definite part of
the lunch, dish the articles, prepare the counters, sell the
various dishes, keep and report sales, and clear the
counters afterward. The groups alternate in order that
preparing food, watching its progress, and taking it from
the stove may be done by all with a minimum loss of
time from their trade instruction. (3) The selection
of girls to take the course is made from (<i>a</i>) those who
can remain long enough in the school to combine trade
training with the simple cooking course, (<i>b</i>) those who
have such poor health that a knowledge of what to
eat and how to cook it is the first consideration, and
(<i>c</i>) those who are already little housekeepers in their
homes, as their mothers are incapacitated or dead.</p>

<p>After several months of experience it was felt that
the six weeks of constant practice was well worth while.
More elaborate courses of cookery would demand a
more thorough kitchen equipment, entailing much expense,
and would require students to remain a longer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
time in school. With the present arrangement they
learn the most important cooking processes in a very
practical way, and discuss the relation of food to themselves
and to their families.</p>

<h3>Trade Orders</h3>

<p>The handwork in the various departments falls into
three grades: 1. Practice work, which not being up to
the standard is ripped up and used again. 2. Seconds;
fair work, not quite up to the school standard for trade
work. This is sold at cost to the students or to needy
institutions. 3. Trade work; up to the standard. This
is sold to the trade or to private customers at regular
market prices. This feature of the school work, entailing,
as it does, the taking of many varieties of orders
from the outside factories and workrooms, has proved
itself to be an important educational factor. After six
years of experience in utilizing orders from the outside
workrooms, it can be said that this part of the instruction
serves the following purposes: (1) It provides the students
with adequate experience on classes of material
used in the best workrooms; these girls could not
purchase such materials and the school could not afford
to buy them for practice. (2) The ordinary conditions
in both the wholesale and the custom trade are thus
made a fundamental part of the instruction. Reality
of this kind helps the supervisors to judge the product
from its trade value (amateur work will thus be rejected),
and the teaching from the kind of workers
turned out. Through the business relation the students<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
quickly feel the necessity of good finish, rapid work,
and responsibility to deliver on time. (3) The orders
bring in a money return and thus aid the school in the
expense for material. (4) The businesslike appearance
of the shops at work on the orders and the experience
trade has had with the product have increased
the confidence of employers of labor in the ability of the
school to train practical workers for the trades. The
school is constantly urged by trade to increase its order
work, but its unfaltering policy is to take only the
amount needed for educational purposes. (5) The
business organization and management required in the
adequate conduct of a large order department can itself
be utilized for educational purposes, and has its value
for training students who show promise of becoming
good stock clerks.</p>

<p>Trade workers are employed in the business shops
connected with the various departments. These assistants
have proved their value in making the best utilization
of the order work. They facilitate the completion
of the work on time and help train the girls to feel
responsible for their share of it. As the students work
slowly at first, and as their hours in the shops are
interrupted by other studies, the trade workers, when
necessary, continue with or complete the articles while
the girls are absent. They make possible the tradelike
organization of the shops, for each one has around her
her own little groups of assistants, and she teaches them
while she also works. Constant repetition of the same
process ceases, after a time, to be valuable to a student,
hence her time must not be wasted by too simple work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
or by unnecessary details. It often happens also that
an article may require expert work in its completion
which the students cannot yet do; the trade workers
select for each girl the process which will be of value
to her, and then do the work the students cannot do or
should not do.</p>

<p>The following lists will show the class of orders
which have been demanded by trade and turned out
by the school:</p>

<h3 class="hd3">Placement Bureau</h3>

<p>From the first the school made some provision for
placing its pupils satisfactorily in the trades for which
they are trained. Originally the heads of departments
attended to it, each for her own students, but as the
school grew and the department work increased this
method ceased to be practical. An arrangement was made,
therefore, with the Alliance Employment Bureau to place
the girls of the Manhattan Trade School when they were
ready to leave the school or whenever they applied for
help thereafter. This was a most helpful connection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
when the work was beginning, but it was understood
that when the school reached the point in its development
where the volume of business was great enough,
and other conditions warranted it, a Placement Bureau
should be opened in the school itself. This long-cherished
idea went into operation in October, 1908, when a Placement
Secretary was engaged and the school bureau was
opened. This plan has already proved advantageous.
In the first place a bureau so situated can, by keeping
in constant touch with the departments, obtain intimate
and detailed information about the character, the work,
the special aptitudes, and the physique of each girl. Such
data are extremely valuable in making wise placements,
but are difficult of access for an outside agency. In the
second place such a school bureau, open to graduates,
tends to bring them occasionally to it, and thus strengthens
their interest in and loyalty to the school by giving
a practical reality to their connection with it.</p>

<h3>Aims</h3>

<p>The aims and working plans of the Placement Bureau
are the following: (1) To secure suitable positions for
girls leaving the school&mdash;those forced out by poverty
as well as those who have really completed their courses.
The problem is to get the square peg into the square
hole, and it is solved by having a very intimate knowledge
of each peg, and by knowing of as large a variety
of holes as possible from which to choose. (2) To be
a means of connection and communication between the
school and the trades, on the one hand, and the school
and its former pupils on the other. (3) To gather data<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
about trade conditions that shall be helpful to the several
departments, or in deciding school policies. (4) To
build up a series of records that shall be of general
sociological value as well as of immediate use for school
purposes.</p>

<h3>Kinds and Methods of Work</h3>

<p>In connection with the placement itself there are four
lines of activity:</p>

<p>1. <i>Interviews</i> in the office, when girls come in to
apply for positions, and when employers ask for workers.
Much valuable data as to the experiences of the girls
who have been some time in the trade have been gathered
in this way. In the case of the employer, if he is not
already familiar with the school, an effort is made to
induce him (or her) to go through it.</p>

<p>2. <i>Trade Visits</i> of investigation. It is the policy
of the Bureau not to place a girl in any establishment
until it has been visited, unless it is one already well
known to the school, in which case the visit may follow
instead of preceding the placement. These visits are
often made upon the request of employers or in response
to advertisements, if, as sometimes happens, a girl wishes
to be placed and the employers already known do not
need additional help.</p>

<p>3. "<i>Following up.</i>" After the girls are placed it is
necessary to keep track of them. In order to do this
satisfactorily, blanks have been printed in two different
forms, one for the employer and the other for the
worker. The former asks about the quality of the girl's
work (whether it is satisfactory, and if not, why not)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and about her wages. The latter asks the girl to report
on her work, wages, and shop conditions. By this system
the Placement Secretary is able to keep in close
touch with the students who have been placed, and to
hear and act upon complaints from either employer or
girl with a promptness that often has the result of establishing
the worker in a "good" place or, occasionally,
rescuing her from a poor one. Employers are almost
uniformly prompt and courteous in returning the reports,
and all but a very small percentage of the students are
equally responsive. In cases where a girl is not heard
from, the Students' Aid Secretary makes a personal visit
to her home.</p>

<p>4. <i>Keeping of Records.</i> Card catalogues are kept,
giving the full data obtainable in each case: (1) for
girls applying for positions; (2) for girls placed;
(3) for employers visited; (4) for employers applying
or worth investigating, but not yet visited. All data
from employers and girls which have been obtained from
the blanks before mentioned or from other sources are
recorded on the cards.</p>

<p>The Placement Bureau, in addition to its specific
work, performs certain services for the general benefit
of the school. Data are obtained as to the conditions of
work and wage in certain trades and the length of training
advisable in others. Advice from the trade is often
needed in one or another of the departments, and
through the Bureau's acquaintance with employers,
managers, or foremen and forewomen, it is able to
ascertain and report their expert opinion. It is also
possible to induce some of these busy people to come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and view the problem in the light of conditions at the
school as well as in their own business.</p>

<h3>General Results</h3>

<p>Although the Placement Bureau is still in its infancy,
some results may be recorded. It is already in touch
with some 700 employers, about 550 having been personally
visited. The table below gives the facts as to
placements in former years, and may be interesting for
comparison.</p>

</table></div>

<p>The column for 1909 shows that at last a minimum
wage of $4.00 has been established for all the trades
named, even Millinery. There are exceptions, but they
are almost always due to some special disability on the
part of the girl, and do not fairly affect a statement
regarding the wage for girls of normal capacity, who
have done satisfactory work during their course. The
small percentage of pupils who fall below $4.00 for their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
initial wage are those who either did not complete the
school course, or who did poor work, or who are subnormal
mentally or handicapped physically, or can work
only an eight-hour day because they are under sixteen.
It is true that when they are obliged to start on piece-work
instead of a week-wage their earnings may fall
below our minimum for a short time, but the first week
or two is in that case not usually a fair test of the
girl's training or ability. Some little time is necessary
for the readjustment involved in the change from school
to workroom, and especially for attaining the "speed"
necessary to earn a fair wage on trade piece-rates. The
compensating advantage is that when she does begin to
"make good" her improvement is usually registered in
her earnings more quickly and accurately than it would
be by the safe but slowly advancing "week-work."
If after two weeks, however, the girl is earning less
than $4.00, and thinks she "never can make out there,"
she is given an opportunity to change her place. But
very often there is a sudden jump in earnings after ten
days or so, as the girl gains confidence and speed. (One
pupil earned $3.97 her first week on buttonholes, and
over $7.00 the second.) Another point to be considered
in connection with the wage is the length of the season
and the duration of any one place. The comparatively
steady work and regular, if small, advance in the dressmaking,
for instance, will often counterbalance the larger
week-wage or piece-work earnings of the trades where
the season is short or the positions of uncertain duration.</p>

<p>On the "rate of advance" in wage the Bureau is as
yet too young to make any general statements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<h3>Students' Aid</h3>

<p>On account of the extreme poverty in the families
of many of the students, some system of aid has always
been necessary. The manner of giving it has changed,
however, that it may be free from all tendency to pauperize
or to deprive the recipient of self-respecting effort.
At first it took the form of a scholarship, paid at the
school every week, in equal amounts, to each student.
A few months' experience, however, showed that it would
be better to require a month's apprenticeship without
pay. If after that the girl was allowed to continue her
course, she was given a dollar a week during her second
month. Each month thereafter the amount was increased
according to the skill and good spirit which were evident
in her work. The maximum amount a student could
receive in one year was $100.</p>

<p>Early in the second year it became clear that a still
more radical change was advisable, and a plan was
adopted whereby the need of the girl's family became
the only basis upon which money was given. A committee
was formed, whose membership was composed principally
of workers from the leading social settlements.
Each applicant for aid was referred to the member of
the committee living nearest her home. An investigation
was made by the settlement worker, and aid was given
in proportion to the necessity, varying in amount from
car fare to the equivalent of a small wage. The girl
went weekly to the settlement for the money. In this
way the aid was separated as far as possible from the
school atmosphere, and it was made clear to the girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and their families that the money was in no sense pay
for work. As indicative of this change in viewpoint,
the term "Scholarship" was replaced by that of "Students'
Aid." In addition to its other advantages, the
new method reduced the cost for aid to less than one-half
of its original proportion.</p>

<p>Since this time the aim has been always the same&mdash;to
aid the girl handicapped by poverty so that she might
prepare herself for efficient wage-earning. A member
of the school staff is secretary of the Students' Aid
Committee, and she knows personally every applicant
wishing aid, and makes the initial visits and investigations.
This plan has proved advantageous in making a
closer connection between the school and the home, and
in securing a more uniform standard of relief.</p>

<p>The Students' Aid Committee consists at present of
representatives from sixteen settlements, who meet twice
a month to discuss and decide upon the merit of each
applicant. If aid is granted, the girl is assigned to the
settlement nearest her home and goes there weekly for
her money. An envelope showing the amount due the
girl is sent from the school to the settlement worker,
and on this is indicated any absence or tardiness. It is
one of the duties of the member of the committee to
inquire the reasons for any irregularity in attendance,
and, if necessary, to report to the parent. In addition,
each settlement worker renders valuable service by
giving friendly oversight to the girls and families in
her group, by doing as much for their welfare as time
will allow, and by reporting any unusual conditions to
the Students' Aid Secretary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Students are at times sent to the school for instruction
with a request for aid from some charitable
institution, church, hospital, school, or settlement which
knows and is interested in the family; but, in general,
a girl needing financial help comes without such recommendations,
and consequently a more thorough investigation
of the case is necessary. Inquiry is always made
at first of the Charity Organization Society, in order to
learn whether her family has received or is receiving
other relief. The "trial month" without aid gives time
for the gathering of facts about the family, and for a
test of the girl's ability and character. Aid is never
promised to a girl before her admission.</p>

<p>A useful method has been worked out for determining
the amount of aid which may be given in any
one case. The total amount of the family income is
obtained, and from it are deducted the fixed expenses
for rent, insurance, and car fare. From the remainder
the per capita income is found which must provide for
all other expenses, that is, for each person's share of
food, clothing, light, fuel, medicine, and all incidentals.
It was estimated that a family could not maintain a
decent standard of living on a per capita income of less
than $1.50 a week. Although each case is considered
on its merits, aid is almost always given when the per
capita income is less than $1.50; in some special cases
it is granted when the income exceeds this amount.
The following table shows the income of the seventy-eight
families that were being aided by the school on
June 3, 1909.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

</table></div>

<p>Relief given by charitable institutions has not been
included in this income.</p>

<p>Each girl receiving aid is told the reason for its
bestowal in such a way that she will neither look upon
it as money earned nor feel humiliated as a recipient of
charity, but will understand that it should mean for her
an opportunity to obtain a good education. It therefore
is incumbent upon her to show a realization of its
value by becoming a responsible and earnest worker.
Students receiving such assistance are expected to attend
regularly, unless for excellent reasons, and the reports
from their departments must be satisfactory in regard
to their work, attitude, and effort. If a girl varies from
this standard and, after talking with her or with one
of her parents, no improvement follows, the aid may be
suspended or withdrawn. Improving circumstances in
a family occasionally make it possible to decrease or even
to give up the aid. On the other hand, it is often found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
necessary to ask additional assistance from special philanthropic
sources when the need is very great.</p>

<h3>Night Classes</h3>

<p>Night continuation classes are a part of the aim of
the school. They have offered training in expert parts
of the Operating, Dressmaking, Novelty, Millinery, and
Art trades. The classes were well attended, the work
successful, and continued application for the renewal
of the instruction has been received. This class of
education requires the most skilled teachers and is consequently
expensive. Lack of money to conduct both
the day and the night work adequately has made it
necessary to close the night classes temporarily. There
is every reason to hope, however, that they will be reopened
in the near future, with still greater facilities
for teaching the advanced parts of the trades.</p>

<h3>Student Government</h3>

<p>The Student Council concerns itself with the government
of the school, the aim being to place it as far as
possible in the hands of the students. It also assists
in developing their sense of responsibility. The Council
is composed of representatives elected from each class,
who have been chosen for their executive ability and
good character. They meet once a week with one of the
supervisors to discuss questions of general school discipline
and regulations. Each member is responsible
for maintaining order in her class when it is not under
other supervision, for settling disputes among the girls,
and for reporting disobedience to school laws.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<h3>Graduate and Department Clubs</h3>

<p>Some form of alumn&aelig; association has been in existence
since the end of the first school year. This
important phase of the Trade School work is now
thoroughly organized, and gains for us the warm co&ouml;peration
of those who have benefited by the instruction.
The Graduate Association includes those who have
received the certificate of the school; the department
clubs, however, are more democratic, and admit to membership
any girl who has been in attendance. These
associations work together for the benefit of the school.
They hold frequent business as well as social meetings.
They plan definite ways for getting in touch with Manhattan
Trade School girls who are just entering trade,
in order to help them to adjust themselves to their work
and to increase in them loyalty and responsibility to the
school; for improving themselves and working girls in
general by discussing topics of interest concerning their
trades, and by giving entertainments which are of real
interest and value. They have carried out schemes for
adding to the general finances of the school or for
obtaining money for special objects, such as shower baths
for the gymnasium. They have given several suppers
to bring the faculty and former students together, in
order to discuss informally trade and school matters.</p>

<h2 class="hd3">PART II</h2>

<h2>REPRESENTATIVE PROBLEMS<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> organizing of a girls' trade school in any given
locality necessitates the meeting of many problems of a
serious nature. Some of these appear immediately and
require consideration before a satisfactory curriculum
can be developed, but most of them are hydra-headed,
and one phase is no sooner settled than another arises.
Attention must be given to them whenever they come if
any progress is to be made in solving the question of the
broadest and yet most practical education for the girl
who must earn her living in trade. These problems are
so connected with the keenest yet most obscure social
and industrial questions of the day on one hand, and,
on the other, with the future of the race, that they are
often very puzzling. Some of them can never be entirely
settled, though they can be temporarily adjusted to immediate
needs. The following are selected as representative.</p>

<h3>Direct Trade Training</h3>

<p>Many schools of a domestic or technical nature have
been opened in the United States, but the instruction in
them is for the home or for educational purposes rather
than for business. The trades, if they are represented
at all in these schools, are general in character, covering
often many branches of an industry in a short series of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
lessons, and not having the particular subdivisions and
special equipment which are found at present in the
regular market. Employers of labor have not been favorably
impressed with the practical usefulness of the
graduates in their workrooms. As the sole reason for
the existence of the Manhattan Trade School is to meet
this requirement of employers, and therefore to develop
a better class of wage-earners directly adapted to trade
needs, the instruction must be in accord with methods
in the shops and factories of New York City. Such
specific trade education for fourteen-year-old girls was
new, and therefore the problem of organization had to
be faced for the first time in America. Careful study of
the workrooms and the industrial conditions of New
York City was essential before the aims or the curriculum
could be decided upon and the school could be
opened for instruction. Furthermore, if the training
is to be kept up to date this study of trade conditions
must not cease, and readjustments of the curriculum
must equal the changes taking place in the outside
workrooms. Consequently these problems must be met
repeatedly.</p>

<h3>Need of Preliminary Training</h3>

<p>On beginning the trade courses at the school a difficulty
was discovered immediately which brought home
the truth of the complaint made by trade that young
workers are utterly incompetent. The students coming
to the school were allowed by law to enter trade, as
they had met all requirements for obtaining their working
papers, but they were not found to have sufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
foundation to begin the first simple steps at the school
without some preliminary training. The defects which
were especially evident were: (1) lack of sufficient skill
with the hand; (2) inability to utilize their public school
academic work in practical trade problems; (3) dullness
in taking orders and in thinking clearly of the needs
which arise; (4) absence of ideals; and (5) need of
knowledge of the laws of health and how to apply them.
Preliminary, elementary instruction in all of these subjects
had, therefore, to be organized and given to the
entering students before they could begin upon their
true trade work. Such instruction is and will continue
to be necessary unless the public elementary school
arranges to give, between the fifth and eighth grades, a
more satisfactory preparation to those who must earn
their living. The Manhattan Trade School has been
obliged to give from two to eight months to elementary
branches of instruction alone. The kind of work needed
varies constantly with the condition of the students.
Every one requires some of it, but many must take
months of tutoring. Public instruction could readily
give the practical academic work which the school has
organized. Such instruction would not only directly help
the pupils who must leave early to work, but would lay
a good foundation for the vocational education which
is being planned for the early years of the public
secondary schools.</p>

<h3>Vocational Training</h3>

<p>As the courses at the Manhattan Trade School developed,
an intermediate phase between the preparatory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
work and the direct trade training took definite shape.
This middle ground partakes in many ways of trade
processes and lays a good foundation for shop work.
It utilizes the early education, gives point to it, awakens
in the student enthusiasm for her chosen trade, and
shows her that it is worth her while to work hard if she
would succeed. It takes from four to eight months,
according to the student's ability to meet the requirements.
Public instruction could also develop this intermediate
field to advantage for those who, not wishing
to enter the regular high school course, would be glad
to avail themselves of further practical education. Such
occupations for women as cooking, sewing, garment and
dressmaking, millinery, laundry work, home nursing,
household administration, care of children, novelty work,
electric power operating, salesmanship, and other interesting
activities can well be offered in Vocational Education.
As the student in her chosen field plans, considers
expenses, and contrives to utilize her material she gains
skill, adaptability, judgment, and the true basis of criticism.
The world's work interests her as its meaning
becomes clear through her own experiences, and she
begins to see ways to better her condition and to be a
factor in the improvement of her home. She appreciates
the value of her early education, and finds it worth while
to think clearly and to act wisely; she listens to instructions,
asks sensible directions, and goes to work without
waste of time. The elementary and intermediate training
just described, which the school found it must give
preparatory to its real trade instruction, has proved
advantageous as an introduction, for the student can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
now quickly adapt herself to the work in the school shops,
as she possesses the foundation qualities needed to make
the best worker. She has to begin at the simplest trade
work, to be sure, but can rise as rapidly as she shows
ability. She has been carefully watched by her instructors
and turned gradually in the direction best fitted to
her.</p>

<h3>Trade Shops</h3>

<p>Offering courses in many varieties of trade work
exactly as they are found in a city like New York has
many recurring difficulties, as has been before stated.
The constant and rapid adaptations to fashion, the new
mechanical devices introduced, and the labor situations
are factors to be considered. The management must be
ready at a moment's notice to change, increase, or drop
work according to the demands of a fickle market. It
would seem, therefore, that at present the problems of
the school trade shops are of too serious and unsettled
a character for adequate solution by public instruction
as at present organized, for (1) it would be difficult to
persuade the mass of taxpayers that added tax rates are
advisable for beginning a continually altering form of
education which has not yet commended itself to all
employers or to all wage-earners, and which must be
more or less expensive; (2) the usual public school
committee man knows little of trade conditions, and
would probably be averse to allowing a school the
freedom to change at will its course of study and even
the very trades it teaches; yet, on the other hand, if the
trade school must wait for board action before altering
its plans, it would prejudice the value of its instruction,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
which must be flexible if it would train its students
directly for the market; (3) the impossibility of obtaining
its teachers from the usual "waiting list" and the
difficulties attending the selection of a satisfactory
teaching force.</p>

<p>The possibilities for offering highly specialized,
skilled work are great, but the poverty of the students
limits their time at the day school. To help all girls
who work, and who wish to get ahead, night classes
have been organized from time to time, and during the
day also temporary instruction is offered to any one who
has a slack time in her trade. As the school is organized
into trade shops, with the same specialization as in the
market, a student can enter or be placed from almost
any point. This increases its usefulness but complicates
its management.</p>

<h3>Obtaining and Training Teachers</h3>

<p>As trade instruction is new in education, the normal
schools have not begun training teachers regularly for
these positions, nor, indeed, are they yet prepared to do
so. The organizer of a trade school faces, therefore, a
serious difficulty in obtaining instructors who are adequate
to the task before them.</p>

<p>The following trade teaching staff is needed: supervisors
of the various trades; forewomen to direct the
school shops; trade instructors to teach the various
groups of students the specialized processes; assistants
to attend to minor matters in the workrooms; art
teachers, who have had experience in designing for the
various trades represented; academic instructors who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
know the working world practically and can give the
students a training which, while helping them in their
trades, will broaden their knowledge of and sympathy
in the world's work. All of these teachers must not
only have had experience in trade, but must continually
keep in touch with the methods of the outside market.
Unsuccessful trade workers, who often wish to teach,
or teachers who know nothing of the needs of trade
workrooms, cannot adequately prepare students for
specific trade positions. Trade knows what it wants,
is a severe critic and an unsparing judge. The trade
school, therefore, cannot afford to rely on instructors
who would be themselves unsuccessful in the market,
for the result would be certain failure in the students.
Such specific training requires exceptional knowledge in
its teaching force. The usual teacher of manual training
knows too little of the ways of the workrooms and
is too theoretical in her instruction to be trusted to train
workers who must satisfy trade demands. On the other
hand, the trade worker, good as she may be in her specialty,
seldom knows how to teach. She can drive her
group of workers, but she cannot train the green hands
to do more than work quickly at one thing. She can
make them work, but she cannot make them better
workers. When she has orders to turn out, her lifelong
training makes her think of the rapid completion of the
articles rather than the careful development of the students
who are making them. If she is not watched she
will choose the girl to do a piece of work who can do
it well and quickly (but who does not need this experience),
rather than the one who should do it in order to
have practice in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The problem is to find a way to unite the good teacher
and the successful worker. Such a combination appears
at rare intervals. At the present time the teacher who
can adequately prepare young workers for trade has to
be taught while she is herself teaching. She may be
chosen from either the industrial or the educational field,
if she has certain qualities of mind and spirit, but she
must now make up the points she lacks, be it experience
in trade or ability to teach. Supervisors need special
insight and capability, as they are called upon to investigate
a new and difficult field, to select from it the subjects
needed, and after that to organize education of a most
practical kind. They combine the duties of school principal,
teacher, forewoman, factory superintendent, and
business manager. They must be willing to give themselves
to the cause, as they are responsible for the
conduct of their departments throughout the year, at
night as well as during the day, at least until they can
train some one to whom they can delegate some of their
responsibility. They need a broad, cultural education
and, at the same time, interest and knowledge of the
industrial problems of the time, as well as experience
in their particular trade. They must have sympathy
with the working people and their lives. It is evident
that such women are hard to find, and when found or
when trained are in demand by other institutions or in
business life, in which places they can command high
salaries. All efficient trade teachers also are equally in
demand in workrooms, hence the school must compete
with good business salaries in place of the usual underpay
of educational institutions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the trade teachers, practical instructors
in healthful living and special secretaries needing social
knowledge of various kinds are also essential in the
modern trade school for girls. Their training adds to
the director's responsibilities, for no one at present has
the knowledge and experience necessary.</p>

<p>The many problems connected with obtaining an
adequate teaching staff seem at present to have but one
solution, <i>i. e.</i>, the school has to be its own training school
for its faculty to a greater or less extent. One source
of assistant teachers has been found in students who
have made good in trade. Pupils of fair education who
show skill and executive ability in their department work
and who later succeed in their trade positions have
already proved helpful when brought back to the school.
Such girls know the courses of instruction, their needs
and difficulties, and also the outside workroom demands.
If they are given some hints in methods of teaching,
their success is greater. European trade schools for girls
have drawn many of the best teachers from the student
body and have organized teachers' training classes for
them. A course of regular training for trade pupil
teachers should be given later in American training
schools to meet this situation.</p>

<h3>Courses of Study</h3>

<p>As the changes about to occur in the market must
be recognized and inserted in the curriculum in time for
the students to be prepared for the new work when they
are placed, set courses of study cannot be followed without
endangering the practical value of the teaching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Furthermore, the pupils must be advanced as they show
ability, and their different characteristics should have
consideration; hence the work must be sufficiently flexible
and adaptable to allow for increasing one kind of training
and decreasing another, in order to develop a girl's
best ability. It is not the trade courses only which
should be fitted to the need, but the trade-art, trade-academic,
and physical education must also shift and
introduce needed material as quickly as would the market
grasp at new plans for the workrooms. Nor is it sufficient
that the curriculum should adapt itself merely to
training girls for trade positions. It is never to be forgotten
that these students are to be made into higher
grade workers and citizens, and that the greater number
of them will marry. In general, it can be said that
woman's entrance into industry is more or less temporary
in that it is apt to precede or to follow marriage,
and, as a rule, is not continuous. Good citizenship for
these young wage-earners should mean the better home
as well as the broader views of industrial life. The
inserting into an already too brief training the important
factors for making the better home-keeper requires
study of the ethics and economics of home and social
life in addition to the study of the industrial situation,
and places continuous problems before the faculty.</p>

<h3>Investigations</h3>

<p>In order to be in vital touch with the practical needs
and changes of the market, special investigations of trade
have been and are continually conducted by the faculty
of the school. Effort is made by them also to keep in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
close contact with industrial and social organizations of
workers in settlements, clubs, societies, and unions, that
all phases of the wage-earner's life, pleasures, aims, and
needs, may be appreciated. The pupils in attendance
are studied to know their conditions of health, their
tendencies, their needs, their improvement. After their
entry into trade they are kept in touch with the school
through the Placement Bureau, clubs, graduate associations,
and also by visits from the school's investigator,
in order to note the effect of their training on their
self-support, their workrooms, and their homes. Groups
of trained and untrained girls are compared, that differences
and benefits may be noted and the true situation
may be clearly understood.</p>

<p>That the essentials of this class of education might
be grasped as far as possible, the director of the school
made a six months' investigation of the professional
schools for girls on the continent of Europe. This study
was made after the Manhattan Trade School had been
organized and was running successfully. The problems
were then well in hand, and advantage could be taken
the better of differing standpoints. In some European
countries such practical instruction has been established
for half a century. Each country has organized the work
according to its own view of woman's position in industrial
and domestic life. Many aspects of the problem
can therefore be studied and various courses of instruction
consulted. This investigation covered three interesting
fields. First, the organization of the schools,
including the equipment; the teachers and their training;
the budget; the order work; the relation of the school<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to employers; the placing of the girls in positions; the
wages; the schemes for financial aid, and the work of
the alumn&aelig; associations. Second, the trades taught and
the courses of instruction; the general education required
at entrance and that given as an integral part of trade;
the trade-art courses; the housekeeping and training of
servants; the development of ideas of better living and the
training for responsibility in home and trade life. Third,
the visiting of workrooms employing women; the obtaining
information on the effect of trade schools; the students'
usefulness and ability to advance, and a survey
of the crafts conducted in the homes of the people.</p>

<h3>Trade Order Administration</h3>

<p>A trade school must do its skilled handwork in the
fashion of the day and on correct materials, yet the
students are too poor to work for themselves. A school
budget cannot supply such large quantities of valuable
materials unless it can get some return for them. The
school shop in each department, where orders both private
and custom are taken, has proved advantageous, but
involves great problems of administration: (1) the
actual business methods and management connected with
the invoices, sales, and delivery of goods; (2) the obtaining
of orders needed and of the quantity desirable;
(3) the taking of custom orders, fitting the customer,
and delivery of orders on time; (4) a satisfactory apportionment
of the order work so that the students may
profit by it and not be expected to continue it after they
have had sufficient experience of one kind, or if they
are not yet able to do the elaborate work involved;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
(5) the finding of operatives who will do what the students
cannot or should not do; (6) the expense involved
in employing workers at trade prices and for shorter
hours; (7) the cost of articles, and other details which
are involved in entering into competition with trade. It
may be stated that no trade school should underbid the
market, but should charge the full prices and expect to
give equivalent returns. A trade school cannot afford
to be an amateur supported by a philanthropic public,
but must have a recognized business standard.</p>

<h3>Placement</h3>

<p>Problems of varied kinds meet the school in placing
its students. Each new enactment of child labor or
industrial laws has its influence. Even a good law will
sometimes have a temporary serious effect in lowering
wages or turning capable girls out of satisfactory positions.
Care must be exercised that students are not
placed where there is a possibility of running counter
to the best interests of labor. The desire to place each
pupil where she can develop to her highest condition
requires continual knowledge of the market needs and
of the characteristics of the many girls. Records of
students entering, studying, and placed, the kinds of positions
open, and industrial and labor information must be
kept up to date, yet such data are often hard to secure.</p>

<h3>Trade Union Attitude</h3>

<p>An important question that is always before a trade
school is the effect the instruction may have on the
working people. It is difficult for one not continually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
in the midst of the pressure of the actual trade to know
the many ways that thoughtless advance in trade teaching
may react to the disadvantage of the very ones that
the school wishes to help. Injury may be done by preparing
too many for certain occupations, filling places
where a strike is on, replacing well-paid positions with
trade school girls at a less price, placing the girls at too
small a wage for their skill, doing order work at too low
a price or when a strike is on, considering too closely
the fitting of a worker for the employer's benefit rather
than for the broadening of her own life, and like thoughtless
actions. The difficulties of the situation are great
and the solution frequently obscure, but a fair-minded
school must be in touch with the effort the working
woman herself has inaugurated to better her condition.
The apparently unnecessary suspicion with which the
laboring class regards the organization of trade instruction
would have foundation if no thought were given to
the trade conditions as the working girl sees them. A
trade school for fourteen-year-old girls need not make
a point of their immediate entrance into unions, but it
should consider the subject simply and wisely in all its
bearings, that the students may know the full aims and
advantages of co&ouml;peration as well as the point of view
and many difficulties of the employers.</p>

<h3>Contact with Trade</h3>

<p>The faculty of a trade school needs the co&ouml;peration
and assistance of the working people and the employers
of labor. Only through intimate interrelation with them
can the best and most practical results be obtained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Auxiliaries and committees of employers and of wage-earners;
visits of the staff of the school to trade, and of
employers, forewomen, and workers to the school; the
carrying out of orders for workrooms and assisting them
at busy seasons, are some of the ways by which the
Manhattan Trade School has tried to gain the help of
the busy industrial world.</p>

<h3>Problems of Financial Aid</h3>

<p>The aid given to enable the poorest students to attend
the school has brought its own questions, such as: the
danger of pauperizing the recipients; the methods of
selecting the beneficiaries; the best way to give the weekly
aid; the development of a spirit of earnest work and
regular attendance in the girls thus aided; the stimulation
of a desire to return some equivalent in special
helpfulness to the Manhattan Trade School or to its
students, and the eliminating of this philanthropic effort
from any apparent relation to school work.</p>

<h2>EQUIPMENT AND SUPPORT</h2>

<h3>Housing and Equipment</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first home of the Manhattan Trade School was
a large four-story and basement dwelling house, for
which a rental of $2,100 per annum was paid. The initial
permanent equipment and first temporary stock provided
for one hundred students, and cost $9,500. This amount
was utilized principally for the furnishing of special
rooms for electric power operating; for sewing; for
dressmaking; for millinery; for pasting; and for the
more general equipment of offices, academic and art
rooms, a kitchen, and a lunch room. The following lists
show the range of expenses for furnishing the main
workrooms with necessary equipment:</p>

<p>A room for twenty workers may be plainly furnished
at a cost of $300 to $500. If a large number of expensive
sewing machines are desired, the estimates must be
increased by several hundred dollars. The Manhattan
Trade School has forty foot-power machines of the kinds
most in use in the workrooms of New York.</p>

<p>The equipping of a workroom for electric power
operating, including general and special machines, motor,
cutting and work tables, cabinets and chairs, will be considerably
more expensive than the one for garment
making. In the latter, one sewing machine can be used
by several workers, but in electric operating each worker
must have her own machine. The electric motor adds
also to the expense. The minimum cost of equipping a
shop for twenty workers would be $1,000 to $1,500. The
necessary equipment would be as follows:</p>

<p class="noin">The Manhattan Trade School has fifty-five plain electric

one zigzag, five hemstitching, five tucker, four Bonnaz,
one braider, one hand embroidery, one scalloping, nine

<p>In workrooms conducting trades which use paste,
gum, and glue, the following special equipment is
required:</p>

<tr><td class="tdl" colspan="3">Cabinets, tables, chairs, and irons, see above</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p class="noin">The cost of equipping a shop would be from $200 to
$400.</p>

<p>Special machines for perforating designs or for
pleating materials are often needed in teaching the garment
trades. Wholesale prices can usually be obtained
when the order is large. Dealers have also shown themselves
willing to sell their machines at low prices, to
loan them, and even to give them to a school which has
proved its ability to train good workers.</p>

<p>When it was appreciated that the original quarters
of the school were too limited, the Board of Administrators
went to work with great enthusiasm and in a few
months collected the requisite money and bought a large
business loft building at 209-213 East 23d Street, at an
expense of $175,000. To put it in order for work cost
$5,000 in addition. The former equipment was used
and $5,000 more was spent for such needed items as:
machines, $3,200; motor, $352; perforating machine,
$38; additional master clocks, $233; chairs and tables,
$850. The school is furnished in a simple, businesslike
manner, the equipment merely reproducing good workroom
requirements, <i>i. e.</i>, essentials only.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>The budget for the first year, 1902-1903, was
$22,094.16, of which the salaries for teachers took about
one-half and the rent and maintenance covered the other
half. During this year there were 113 students admitted.
In 1908-1909, after six years of rapid growth,
the educational budget is $49,000, or more than double
the original, of which the salaries are $38,806; the supplies,
$1,710; printing and publishing, $600; maintenance,
$9,900. At the beginning of 1908 there were 254
students in the school; 689 were registered during the
year, making a total of 943 girls, being almost nine
times the number in attendance during the first year.</p>

<h3>The Support</h3>

<p>The Manhattan Trade School has depended for its
support entirely upon voluntary contributions. There
have been few large donations and the donors represent
all classes of the community&mdash;patrons of and workers
in sociological, economic, philanthropic, and educational
fields, employers of labor, and auxiliaries of many kinds
of workers organized for special purposes. The most
significant help, perhaps, and the largest in proportion
to its income, has been that of the wage-earners themselves&mdash;not
only the girl who has benefited by the instruction,
but the general mass of women workers.
These women, knowing the difficulties in their own
struggle to rise, have shown themselves willing to set
apart weekly a small sum to help young girls to attain
quickly efficiency through systematic training. The
auxiliaries of wage-earners are a mainstay of the
school on account of their helpful enthusiasm, their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
practical suggestions, their interest in girls trained there,
and their regular subscriptions on which the Board of
Administrators can depend.</p>

<h2>OUTLINES AND DETAILED ACCOUNTS OF DEPARTMENT WORK</h2>

<h3>The Faculty and Staff</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> original staff of the Manhattan Trade School,
1902-1903, consisted of a Director, an Executive Secretary,
4 supervisors (Operating, Dressmaking, Pasting,
and Art), 5 instructors and forewomen, 4 or 5 assistants
and occasional workers, a janitor, and 2 cleaners.
The present staff, 1909-1910, consists of (1) <i>Office
Administration</i>, 11: Director, Executive Secretary, Assistant
Secretary, 2 Stenographers (office and placement),
Placement Secretary, Investigator, Business Clerk, Buyer,
and 2 Assistants (records, telephone, etc.). (2) <i>Teaching
Force, Supervisors, and Assistant Supervisors</i>, 7:
Dressmaking, Dressmaking workroom, Electric Operating,
Millinery, Novelty, Physical Education, Art. <i>Instructors,
Teachers, and Forewomen</i>, 11: Academic, 2;
Dressmaking, 3; Operating, 5; Art, 1. <i>Assistants</i>, 14:

Education, 2; Art, 1. (3) <i>Doctor.</i> (4) <i>Care of Building</i>,
7: Engineer, Janitor, Machinist, Cleaners 2, Elevator
boy, and Night watchman.</p>

<h3 class="hd3">Administration</h3>

<h3>Admission Requirements</h3>

<p>I. Age: fourteen to seventeen years. The law
requires a child to remain in public school until fourteen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
The Manhattan Trade School has found that under
fourteen a girl is too immature to specialize in trade
work, and that over seventeen most girls are too mature
to fit into the work planned for the majority of the class.</p>

<p>II. Public School Grade: 5-A or above. The subject
matter of 5-A grade or its equivalent is required by the
state before a child can leave to work. If for illness
or other good cause a girl has not made this grade, she
is admitted to the Trade School with special permission of
principal of last school attended, and, while studying her
trade, the necessary amount of schooling is made up to
her by special classes and coaching. The Board of Health
recognizes this substitute.</p>

<p>Grade of girls admitted since beginning is shown in

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>During 1908, 143 older women were admitted to a
special workroom opened for the "unemployed."</p>

<p>III. Filing of working papers is required of girls
under sixteen.</p>

<p>1. No girl under sixteen can work in New York
unless she has an Employment Certificate issued by the
Board of Health, and then only from 8 <span class="smcapl">A.M.</span> to 5 <span class="smcapl">P.M.</span>,
or for eight hours daily.</p>

<p>2. The public school last attended by the girl is
responsible for her until she is sixteen, or has her working
papers, or is dismissed to another school. If dismissed
to Manhattan Trade School her attendance there
cannot be made compulsory, and she may attend a few
days and then leave and work illegally. Our facilities
for following up such cases are limited. With her working
papers on file we know she is not evading the law,
and can dismiss her to work if she is not a success in
trade lines of training.</p>

<p>3. Exceptions: Lack of proper birth record, on
account of foreign birth or failure to make record of it
by officials, may prevent the obtaining of an Employment
Certificate. A special provision is made by the Board
of Health in such cases, and, pending adjustment, the
girl is admitted upon notice of date of future issuance.</p>

<p>IV. Reference: Some reliable person's name is required
of each applying student, in order to have some
one to communicate with in case of difficulty of any
kind.</p>

<p>V. Application in person: Each girl fills out an
application blank giving name, address, and birthplace
of self, father, and mother, public school attendance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
previous trade experience, if any, trade desired, reference.
This must be written at the school, for the manner
in which it is done is a large part of test for admission.</p>

<h3>Times of Admission</h3>

<p>The school year begins in July, but a girl is admitted
any Monday when there is a vacancy in the department
she wishes to enter. The following table gives record
of yearly admission:</p>

<div class='center'>

<tr class="tr5"><td class="tdb" colspan="3">Total</td><td class="tdj">2,651</td></tr></table></div>

<p>Some of these students did not remain long enough
to take a thorough training, for home demands made
even a small wage imperative, and the girl had to
join the ranks of earners ill prepared. Some were not
adapted to trade conditions, and soon fell out by the
way. Many persisted until they took more than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
average twelve months' course, and went into business
at a proportionately higher wage.</p>

<h3>Records</h3>

<p>I. Attendance: 1. Daily, Monday to Friday inclusive.
The factory method of time cards punched by a clock
upon entrance and leaving has been adopted as being
most exact, businesslike, and time saving. It registers
the exact time when rung, and so indicates tardiness as
well as absence.</p>

<p>2. Weekly. A small filing card ruled for fifty-two
weeks summarizes the daily record of time cards and
requires the marking attendance only once a week. This
file is subdivided into departments and again into classes,
so that the statistics of enrollment are easily gathered.</p>

<p>II. Individual records: 1. Upon admission a record
card is started for each girl, no matter how long she may
attend. This contains (1) the data given upon the application
blank copied in detail; (2) Student Aid, if given,
amount, date, and remarks.</p>

<p>2. Upon leaving, entries are made on the same
card of (1) date and cause of leaving; (2) record in
different departments&mdash;Art, Academic, Trade, and
Health; (3) certificate&mdash;kind, record, date. This is not
granted until the pupil has proved satisfactory in her
trade both in the school and in business; (4) Trade
Record&mdash;upon the reverse side of the card is the "record
in trade after leaving school," with columns for date,
employer, kind of work, wages, remarks. This is kept
up by the Placement Secretary by frequent visits and
letters, and gives the basis for many valuable deductions
as to the practical results of the training.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>III. Other records kept in departments are (1) Student
Aid: application and information; (2) Health:
examinations upon entrance and future re&euml;xaminations;
(3) Department: records of each girl as she passes from
class to class, such as "attitude," speed, and skill.</p>

<h3>Length of Year</h3>

<p>The school is in session forty-eight weeks each year,
four weeks being given up to one-week vacations at
Christmas, Easter, Fourth of July, and Labor Day. The
summer session is the beginning of the regular work,
and not a unit for summer training. No one is admitted
for the summer only, as the time is too short for real
trade standards to be approached.</p>

<h3>Tuition</h3>

<p>The tuition is absolutely free. The Manhattan Trade
School aims to reach the poorest girl who has little
chance to advance rapidly unless some one gives her
a lift. In order to do this most effectively it is sometimes
necessary to assist her. (See the report of the
Student Aid Work.)</p>

<h3>Choice of Trade</h3>

<p>A girl upon application can select the trade into
which she wishes to go. If after a month's trial she
proves competent, she is allowed to continue; if not,
she is advised to change to another department or to
seek employment in work not taught at the Trade School.
If a girl has no choice of trade because of ignorance of
possibilities, she is shown the kinds taught and given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
a chance to make a selection. If then she is undecided,
she is advised to take what seems best adapted to the
time she can spend and the type of girl she appears
to be.</p>

<h3>Business Management</h3>

<p>However simple a school is, some bookkeeping is
necessary, and when with the running of the school
is combined the management of trade order supplies and
receipts the problem becomes very complicated. (See
Trade Order Work.)</p>

<p>I. General: A system of up-to-date bookkeeping of
General Ledger, Invoice Book, and Daily Exhibit, with
details worked out in Petty Cash and Maintenance
Books, has been adopted. These few simple books so
distribute accounts of expense and receipts that one can
soon see the standing of the whole school or of a single
department. All bookkeeping is centralized in one office,
except the taking of orders and the details of filling
them, which must be in the hands of the department
concerned.</p>

<p>II. Departmental: 1. Requisition blanks for purchases
made. 2. Order blank and duplicate for order
given by customer. 3. Time slips, wherever possible, to
get exact record of time value of work done. 4. Material
slips, to keep account of what has gone into any
orders. 5. Final billing, to give data for bills sent out
from main office and duplicate filed there for final
records.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="hd3">The Power Machine Operating Department</h3>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>To train girls to work on sewing machines run by
electric power and to put a thinker behind every machine
as its operator. The department hopes by awakening
intelligent interest in the tool, <i>i. e.</i>, the machine, to kindle
ambition in the workers. It is only through the intelligent
use of the tool and consequent love of work which
follows that we can look forward to supplying the
skilled machine workers of the future. This training
must be given while the girls are in the formative period,
to develop habits of thought and action which will
counteract the bad effects upon the worker that follow
division and subdivision of work, with consequent subdivision
of ability, which takes place in all factories today.
When a pupil has been thoroughly trained in the intelligent
use of her tool, when she has learned to construct
complete garments, if she is then, through force of
circumstances such as modern production entails, compelled
to carry out one process on the machine indefinitely,
or to make one part of a garment, she still holds
the balance of power in being prepared to do something
else when opportunity or necessity demands.</p>

<h3>General Steps in Training</h3>

<p>I. A pupil must be given a short time to adjust
herself to the workshop environment, consequently she
is put first at some simple work, such as ripping or cutting
up old garments. This gives her freedom while
using her hands to look about the workroom and to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
accustomed to the sight as well as to the sound of
machines in action.</p>

<p>II. The pupil is taught to control the power by
which the machine is run, and is then given an intelligent
understanding of the mechanism of the machine or
machines she is to operate.</p>

<p>III. The pupil then begins her regular course of
work, and her feeling of responsibility of the value of
<i>time</i> is awakened&mdash;that is, her seconds, minutes, and
hours, days, weeks, and months are now important
factors in her life, and they may be used for good or
evil. In the language of the department, time may be
spent wisely or foolishly, and, while studying at the
Manhattan Trade School, seven hours out of every day
of the girl's life is given over to productive work and
should be accounted for. The department has developed
its own plan of time payments, which is much like the
piece-work system employed in trade. Through its rewards
for time well spent it makes the fact real to the
pupils, as no form of punishment could do, that wasted
time is gone forever.</p>

<p>The department is divided into five classes, three of
which must be taken to make an all-round operator,
namely: Elementary, two months' course; Intermediate,
four months' course; Advanced, six months' course. In
trade, salaries for such positions range from $5 to
$15. The other two classes train specialists on the
electric machines, special machines of various kinds,
straw-sewing machines. Special machine work requires
from three months to one year in addition to the full
course of all-round operating. Salaries range from $6<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to $30. An expert trade worker is in charge of each
class.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><i>Course of Work</i></p>

<p>Regular Operating Course:</p>

<div class="bk3"><p>1. Control of power&mdash;learning names and uses of
parts of machines. Making bags, clothes, and operator's
equipment.</p>

<p>2. Straight and bias stitching, equal distance apart.</p>

<p>8. Quilting: Following designs made by pupils in
Art Department. Practice for control of power, starting
and stopping machine at given point.</p>

<p>9. Banding: Straight and bias bands placed by

(See Order Work): Infants' slips, children's underwear;
children's rompers; children's dresses; women's underwear;
shirtwaists; aprons; house dresses; fancy negligees.</p></div>

<p>Special Machine Work:</p>

<p class="bk3">Buttonholes; tucking; two-needle work; hemstitching;
Bonnaz (Corneli) embroidery; machine hand embroidery,
scalloping. Students of special ability only
are fitted to take this course. One girl in fifteen has
usually the requisite application and self-control to
operate a special machine successfully. Each machine
is specialized, <i>i. e.</i>, does its own particular work and no
other. Patient attention to little things is required on
the part of the operator in order that good results may
be produced. Such machines are supposed to need only
a hand behind them to guide the work. Our experience
has proved to us that good results are produced only
when intelligence and patience are factors. In the factories,
machinists keep the special machines in order, but
the school aims to train the operator to keep her own
machine in good condition, thus saving her valuable
time.</p></div>

<p>Bonnaz (Corneli) embroidery work offers excellent
opportunities for correlation with the Art Department.
Both Bonnaz (Corneli) and machine hand embroidery
must be felt in the muscles before they can be carried
out on the material, therefore the work with the pencil
in making designs which are to be carried out on the
machine is of first importance. Free-hand designs must
be made first in large, free movements on the machine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
until the arm muscles are thoroughly familiar with the
curve, sweep, and feeling to be executed. After mastery
of movement and sweep are acquired, the same designs
may be reduced in size ten or twenty times and the pupil
will still work them out in perfect rhythm. After the
mastery of movement is acquired, the cording, braiding,
and three-thread attachment work are easily learned by
a pupil who has the necessary mechanical sense. The
course of Bonnaz (Corneli) work covers: chain stitch,
lettering, appliqu&eacute; work, cording, braiding, three-thread
work.</p>

<p>Machine hand embroidery should be given as a
supplementary course to Bonnaz (Corneli) embroidery.
It gives excellent training in design and color work.</p>

<p>Special trade machine straw sewing should also be
taken up after the regular course in operating. It gives
splendid exercise for quick handling of material, but
makes a poor foundation of itself on which to build a
painstaking, expert, all-round operator. Speed is the
first requisite in getting a hat properly shaped, as the
straw braid is flying through the machine at the rate
of four thousand stitches a minute; hence the general
operating is given first to the pupil to train her in the
requisite neatness. As straw-sewing has long slack seasons,
the operator can during such times return to the
regular operating.</p>

<h3 class="hd3">Dressmaking Department</h3>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>The aim of the Dressmaking Department is to train
girls in the elements of the dressmaking trade, in order<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to enable them to immediately secure employment as
improvers and finishers or as assistants on skirts, waists,
and sleeves, and to give them a preparation which will
help them eventually to rise to positions of skill and
responsibility. The training eliminates the errand girl
and apprenticeship stages, and makes possible a living
wage at the start. The result is accomplished in from
nine to seventeen months, the time depending entirely
upon the capability of the girl, her physical condition,
her application to her work, her regularity of attendance,
and her previous training.</p>

<h3>Classes</h3>

<p>The department is divided into three sections:
(1) The Elementary, which consists of two classes
for the teaching of simple sewing and machine work.
This section is rendered necessary by the poor preparation
of the students at the entrance. It would be not
only practical but desirable for elementary public and
industrial schools so to train their students that they
could omit this part of the Manhattan Trade School
course. (2) The Vocational. This section also includes
two classes. The work is tradelike in character, but
much time has to be given to developing right habits
of work as well as to learning specific kinds of handwork.
The public secondary schools could offer this
section to advantage, and through it train pupils for a
better knowledge of the home or for future livelihood.
(3) The Trade Section. This is a business shop, which
reproduces trade conditions as nearly as possible and
is subdivided into the same progressive divisions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Although the object is to work as trade does, the educational
aim is also prominent, and the course of training
has been planned with both ends in view. Order
work plays an important part in this section, for it
makes possible the quantity and variety of material
necessary to supply the many repetitions of important
phases of dressmaking, the new views of old principles,
and the elaborate costume manufacturing which are
needed in the training. It would be impossible for a
school to adequately deal with the many varieties of
garments in this trade without some equivalent for the
order work. The use of models or of practice material
is not satisfactory on account of the great difference
between theoretical and practical knowledge in handling
valuable materials. A girl may learn to run fine tucks
on cheesecloth, but this will not enable her to do satisfactory
hand-tucking on chiffon. Neither is it a correct
educational or economic principle to cut up quantities
of good material, which the students will look upon as
"rags," and then, after working on them, to throw them
into a receptacle for waste or sell them simply to get
rid of them. To secure the best results in any line of
instruction there must be interest and enthusiasm. The
aim, therefore, must be definite and the results vital.
The work is planned to foster these higher qualities. The
students produce articles for a definite use; they are
given a required time in which the work should be completed;
trade itself sets the standard of judgment, and
a definite relation exists between the work of all the
classes, so that old principles may be recognized when
presented in new forms.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<h3>Courses of Work</h3>

<p>I. Elementary Section. (1) Beginners' Class. First,
a test is given each girl when she enters which enables
her instructor to judge of her ability in sewing. It has
been found necessary, in the majority of cases, to teach
all or the greater part of the following principles: the
use of sewing utensils, the making of the stitches, their
application in articles, and the running of the sewing
machine. Hence the second step has been a course of
work covering the use of these needed principles, each
girl beginning at the point where she needs training.
Third, the final test. On the satisfactory completion of
this very elementary training a test is given to show a
girl's ability to work, to think, and to utilize ideas. If
she is not yet fully prepared, further time is spent
in emphasizing the points she still requires.</p>

<p>The work in the Beginners' Class is done upon articles
which have a trade value and which are sold to
customers or to the students for about the cost of the
materials. The school furnishes the materials for all
elementary work, but the students must provide their
own tools and keep them in good condition. These include
a thimble, needles, scissors, a tape measure, an
emery, and a white apron.</p>

<p>Class instruction followed by individual criticism
is the method of teaching in the Elementary Section.
Emphasis is placed upon the proper use of the utensils,
the position of the body, and the handling of the work.
Individual records are kept of the grade of work and
of the time taken to finish a problem. The course takes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
from two to three months to complete, and the students
are at work four and one-half hours per day.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Outline of Work in Beginners' Class</span></p>

<div class="bk3"><p>1. Stitches and special forms of sewing: Basting,

<p>7. Materials used: Cotton, linen, silk.</p></div></div>

<p>(2) Intermediate Class. The Beginners' Class gives
most of its time to hand sewing, the Intermediate Class<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
emphasizes machine sewing. The work is a repetition
of the principles taught in the Beginners' Class, but is
presented in a different manner, with new applications.
Orders are taken from individuals or business houses
for the garments which are made in this course. The
price is that of the trade. These orders furnish a market
for the entire output of the class. A certain amount of
class instruction is given, but the girls are expected to
do independent work under supervision.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Outline of Work in Intermediate Class</span></p>

<div class="bk3"><p>1. Review of former principles on new garments:
(1) French seam&mdash;straight edges, baby slips and nightgowns.
(2) Hems, (<i>a</i>) straight, (<i>b</i>) turned by hand,
on princess aprons, bloomers, sleeves, etc., (<i>c</i>) turned by

<p>3. List of articles made for stock and order: Aprons&mdash;princess,
maids', fancy. Women's clothes&mdash;dressing
sacques, nightgowns, kimonos, lounging robes, house
dresses, chemises, drawers, skirts (washable, mohair,
silk), collars, and corset covers. Children's clothes&mdash;nightdresses,
night drawers, drawers, skirts, rompers,
dresses, and aprons.</p>

<p>4. Materials used: Cotton, silk, woolen, and
worsted.</p></div></div>

<p>II. Vocational Section. The increasing demand for
ready-made clothing has opened a new field for girls
obliged to enter the business world as soon as the law
will permit them to leave school. This requires hand
finishing on fancy waists and plain and fancy gowns,
which are made by the dozens on machines run by electric
power. It is not necessary to have a knowledge of
actual dressmaking to be able to do this work. The
ability to do good handwork rapidly is the prerequisite.
In some establishments there are opportunities for girls
of ability to rise from finisher to draper, which latter
position commands a high wage.</p>

<p>The producing of fine, handmade underwear, waists,
and dresses is another opportunity for girls who can
take but a short time in which to prepare to earn their
living. Work of this character is of a much higher grade<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
than that of the wholesale finishing, and demands the
ability to do extremely good hand and machine work.
The worker must be able to handle the finest kind of
materials and to do the most intricate work, such as hand
tucking, setting in lace, and trimmings.</p>

<p>Although the course in the Vocational Section trains
for specific branches, it is very necessary that all dressmaking
students should have experience in these lines in
order to be better prepared for the actual dressmaking.
If, however, a girl has the ability to do the work of these
classes, she is allowed to skip either one or both of them.</p>

<p>Course of work in the Shop for Gymnasium and
Swimming Suits: The students are drilled for one or
two months in putting garments together, stitching, and
finishing. As but two kinds of garments are made,
speed is acquired and a certain amount of accuracy is
gained through much repetition. Definite arrangements
have been made through wholesale houses for the disposition
of the product. The materials are furnished by
the school. The price is that of trade.</p>

<p>(1) Articles: Swimming suits (patented), bathing
suits, and gymnasium suits. (2) Materials used: Cotton,
wool, worsted.</p>

<p>Course of work in White Work Class: The previous
training having been a general one for accuracy, speed,
and the mastery over mind and hand, attention is now
given for two and one-half or three months to fine
detail work and the handling and keeping fresh and
clean of the daintiest of cotton goods. The materials
are furnished by the school and the work is sold to
customers at trade prices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>(1) Principles: Hand-tucking, rolling and whipping,
mitering corners, overhanding trimming, inserting lace
and embroidery by hand and machine, fine featherstitching,
and white hand embroidery. (2) Garments for
stock and order; fine underwear, waists, and baby
clothes. (3) Material used: cotton.</p>

<p>III. Trade Section&mdash;The Business Shop. Trade
demands skilled workers, and preference is given to those
who have had practical training. The trade section aims
to add experience to skill by offering the students the
actual work and conditions demanded in the outside
market. The general scheme is the one in use in
moderate-sized dressmaking establishments.</p>

<p>The workroom has its tables devoted to separate
kinds of work, the students obtain a definite amount of
knowledge from each experience, and pass from one
to the other as rapidly as their ability to grasp the principles
will permit. Each division is in charge of an
instructor with practical trade experience, who prepares
and supervises the work and also does the skilled parts
which the students, on account of their lack of experience,
are unable to do.</p>

<p>The girls are not taught cutting, fitting, and draping,
as trade would not permit a sixteen-year-old girl to
attempt this work on account of her lack of judgment
and experience; but they have the opportunity to see and
assist in the preparation of work. No girl in the trade
shop will make a complete garment, but she will have
worked upon all parts many times.</p>

<p>Custom orders supply the shop with work. The
customers are interviewed, measurements are taken, estimates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
are given, and dates for fittings are planned. The
information obtained is recorded upon blanks prepared
for the purpose. The materials are purchased, the garments
cut, and the different parts (skirts, waists, sleeves)
are delivered to the tables where such work is done.
Blanks are provided for the recording of all materials
used for customers' work, and from these the bills are
made out in the main office. Stock is obtained from the
storerooms on signed requisitions only. The stock clerk
measures and delivers the materials and notes the amount
withdrawn on each package.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="bk3"><p>Course in Dressmaking Shop:</p>

<p>1. Linings: Waist (practice materials): basting,
stitching, pressing, binding, boning (whalebone, featherbone);
hooks and eyes; facing; overcasting.</p>

<p>2. Shirtwaists and nurses' uniforms: Covering rings;
making shirtwaist cuff; making shirtwaist placket; putting
on neckbands.</p>

<p>3. Skirts: Petticoats or drop skirts for; basting,
stitching, pressing; seams, bands, plackets; trimming,
pinning, putting on band.</p>

<p>4. Trimmed skirts: Slip stitching; milliner's and flat
folds; covering buttonholes; binding, shirring, cording,
tucking, piping, facing, braiding.</p>

<p>5. Trimmed waists: Application of principles; experience
in making and applying trimming and handling
delicate or perishable materials.</p>

<p>6. Trimmed sleeves: Application in general knowledge
and experience in applying trimmings.</p>

<p>7. Garments made in the shop: Shirtwaists, fancy
dressing sacques and wrappers; nurses' and maids' uniforms;
dancing dresses; elaborate waists; street, afternoon,
and evening gowns; tailored suits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>8. Materials used: All varieties of cotton, linen, silk,
woolen, and worsted dress fabrics; chiffon, mousseline,
and trimmings of all kinds.</p></div></div>

<p>IV. Results of training. A change in the general
appearance of the girls is soon apparent, for which
ability to make their own clothes and the refining influence
of the doing of good work on good materials is
probably responsible. The elements of good order,
obedience, thoughtfulness, judgment, self-control, industry,
and thrift are fostered, and every effort is put
forth to make intelligent workers.</p>

<p>The fact that on entering trade the girls from the
Trade School receive nearly double the salary given
untrained girls indicates that they are fitted for the outside
workrooms.</p>

<p>V. Departmental relations. The emphasis which the
Academic and Art Departments have laid upon accuracy,
careful work, appreciation of measurements, distances,
color, and form has been of great value to the students
in the Dressmaking Department. The Operating Department
has also been of service in training some of the
students to work on special machines, thus enabling
them to make dress decoration. The use of the electric
power machine in custom dressmaking establishments is
on the increase.</p>

<p>VI. Trade relation. The department is kept in close
touch with trade conditions through personal visits,
through the houses which purchase its output, and through
those from whom the stock is bought. Many opportunities
to purchase materials at reduced rates have been
secured through the kindly interest of the trade.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>An advisory board, composed of business men and
women, has been appointed to pass judgment upon the
scheme of work, the standard and quality of work, and
the cost and market value of the products.</p>

<h3 class="hd3">Millinery Department</h3>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>The aim of the Millinery Department is to train
assistants, improvers, frame makers, and preparers for
wholesale and custom workrooms.</p>

<h3>Short Course</h3>

<p>When this department was first opened the scope of
the work for the day classes was much more extended
and included training for copyists, designers, and milliners.
The curtailing of the course to more elementary
preparation was brought about by a feeling of dissatisfaction
with this trade for the young, untrained, or partly
skilled workers. Close and continued contact with
millinery shops showed that for young wage-earners a
small, initial wage and a not very rapid rise are usual;
that a short, irregular, seasonal engagement is almost
inevitable; that a long experience is needed before even
the trained girl can rise to the higher positions; that
young workers become discouraged and are apt to drop
the trade altogether, even for lower wages, if they can
obtain steady work in another occupation. As it was
the fourteen or fifteen-year-old girl who came for the
instruction, it was better for her to be well trained as
an assistant than to detain her at the school for a more
advanced position which she would probably not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
allowed to take on account of her youth and inexperience.
Students in this department need to be watched with
especial care to determine whether they are well adapted
for their occupation, and the mediocre worker would
better enter some other field where the opportunities for
her are more encouraging. As the advance is slow the
girl also whose poverty is hurrying her into wage-earning
would better not elect this work.</p>

<p>The night classes which have been offered at the
school gave training in the more advanced lines of
millinery. The day classes are also prepared to do so
whenever older workers feel they can give time for the
instruction.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><span class="smcap">Course of Instruction</span></p>

<div class="bk3"><p>Length of course: Six months.</p>

<p>1. Practice: Shirring, tucking, cording, rolled hem,
plain fold, milliner's fold, and cutting and joining bias
pieces.</p>

<p>2. Making and covering buckles and buttons; wiring
ribbons and laces; making hat linings and wiring hats.</p>

<p>3. Bandeaux: Wire, capenet, and buckram.</p>

<p>4. Wire frame construction from dimensions and
models; making frames of buckram, capenet, and stiff
willow.</p>

<p>5. Covering frames with crinoline, capenet, mull,
maline, and soft willow.</p>

<p>6. Facings: Plain, shirred, and in folds.</p>

<p>7. Bindings: Stretch, puff, and rolled.</p>

<p>8. Plateaux: Plain and fancy.</p>

<p>9. Making hats of straw, silk, chiffon, maline, and
velvet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>10. Sewing trimmings on hats and sewing linings
in hats.</p>

<p>11. Renovating: Ribbon, velvet, lace, feathers,
flowers.</p>

<p>12. Machine work: Plain stitching, tucking, shirring,
bias strips stitched on material.</p></div></div>

<p>Orders are taken for a limited amount of trimmed
hats in order to provide the students with experience in
preparing, sewing on the trimming, and in finishing the
hat.</p>

<p>As millinery is a seasonal trade, students are advised
to take, in addition, lamp and candle shade making in
the Novelty Department, or straw sewing in the Operating
Department. They are thus provided with good trades
during the months when their own trade is dull.</p>

<h3 class="hd3">Novelty Department</h3>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>(1) To teach the use of paste and glue in several
good trades. (2) A short course in lampshade and
candleshade making for girls who have a dull season in
their regular trade during November, December, and
January.</p>

<h3>Lines of Work</h3>

<p>Sample mounting, novelty work, jewelry and silverware
case making, lampshade and candleshade making.</p>

<h3>Trades and Wages</h3>

<p>Sample mounting is pasting or gluing samples of all
kinds of material on cards or in books to be used by
salesmen in selling goods. New York is a center for this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
class of work. It gives year-round employment to many
girls, and offers wages from $5 to $15 a week. The
simpler lines of sample mounting can be learned by almost
any girl. A bright student can learn this trade in six
months.</p>

<p>Novelty work is the covering and lining of cases and
boxes with different materials. Girls can earn from $5
to $18 a week, and can learn the trade in from eight
months to a year.</p>

<p>In jewelry and silverware case making the girls are
taught both to cover and line up the cases; they earn
from $5 to $15 a week. It takes from eight months to
a year to learn this trade.</p>

<p>Lampshade and candleshade making: A short course
is offered to good sewers who wish to learn a line of
work that will give them employment during November,
December, and January, which is the busy season in this
occupation. Girls can earn from $1 to $2 a day. It is a
very good course for millinery workers, as the work is
similar and therefore easily learned, and the slack time
in millinery is the busy time in this trade.</p>

<h3>Course of Work</h3>

<p>All pupils entering the Novelty Department take a
short course in sample mounting to learn the use of
paste and glue. Some are advanced soon to the novelty
work, while others continue in sample mounting, taking
up a greater variety of work along that line. Those
entering for lamp and candle shade making do not take
the sample mounting, but come from the millinery or
sewing classes, where they have had some training with
the needle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<h3>Interrelation with Academic and Art Work</h3>

<p>In the academic classes the girls are drilled in
measurements and have problems estimating the cost
of materials and labor. Their discussions pertain to
actual processes and materials used in the classes of the
Novelty Department.</p>

<p>In the art classes the girls are trained to draw
straight lines and square corners, to miter corners, to
fold on a line, to make good letters and figures, and to
appreciate good proportions and balance. This work
enables the student to arrange her samples in straight
lines on the card, with proper margins, and to print
neatly on the card the name of the materials and stock
numbers. The discussion of materials helps her to cut
and place her materials on the cases so that the design
will appear to the best advantage. The color work aids
her in choosing the best hues of ribbons or linings to
use with the figured coverings.</p>

<h3>Orders</h3>

<p>Where trade orders can be used without keeping
the girls too long on the one problem, they prove a great
incentive and also help them to acquire speed. Private
orders give more variety in the work, and thus enable
the girls to adjust themselves more easily to each season's
new styles. The private orders, however, being smaller
in number, do not help the students to acquire the speed
that the repetition does in the large trade orders. Each
kind of order work is used, as it can be of advantage
to the development of the student.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="hd3">Art Department</h3>

<p>The courses of work in the Art Department are
shaped according to the needs of each trade department.
Various phases of work in dressmaking, electric power
operating, novelty, and millinery are made "centers of
interest." Each girl thus finds her art aiding her to be
more valuable in her trade. Her enthusiasm is awakened
and she is stimulated to self-expression directly along
the line of her chosen work. The entering students
lack in the technical skill which can be used in their
trades. The first step, therefore, is to give the elementary
exercises needed in their departments. This is
followed by more difficult and more artistic work as the
student shows ability.</p>

<h3>Aims</h3>

<p>To help the work of the trade departments, to improve
the trade selected by each student, to give ideals.</p>

<h3 class="hd3">Academic Department</h3>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>I. Elementary: To supplement previous schooling.
Girls who have left the public school from low grades
need special tutoring in the common branches. Special
instruction is also needed for newly arrived foreigners.</p>

<p>II. Trade: To quicken and enrich the mind, that
the girl may become a more efficient, intelligent, and
enthusiastic trade worker.</p>

<p>The work falls under the following subjects: Civics,
Industries, Arithmetic, English.</p>

<h3>Civics</h3>

<p>This course is given as a means of enabling the pupil
to recognize her place in the family, the school, the community,
and in the world's work. For lack of a better
term it is called Civics. It is dealt with under two heads:
(1) Community Life in General, (2) Community Life
in New York City.</p>

<p>1. Under the first head the discussion of life in a
given community is followed by the simple facts that
lie at the foundation of civic life. These are approached
through the interests or desires which the pupil feels in
common with all other people. Building still further
on the pupil's own experience, she is led to apply the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
ideas received to her own community, which ever widening
its scope is carried from the neighborhood or the
school to the city, the state, and on to the nation.</p>

<p>Civics also gives to the pupils a knowledge of the
existing laws under which they will work, by whom
these laws are made, and the possible means for improving
them. In the discussion of such subjects as Tenement
House Laws, Child Labor Laws, and Trade-Unions,
there is opportunity for the introduction of home and
business economics which have been found to be valuable.
Economics is further taught by the detailed discussion
of the apportionment of an income of $6 a week
for fifty working weeks, considering car fare, lunches,
savings, a portion toward family support, and an allowance
for clothes. The literature for this course is
obtained from the United States Department of Commerce
and Labor, the State Department of Factory
Legislation, the Consumers' League, the National and
State Labor Committees, and current magazines. Mr.
Arthur M. Dunn's, "The Community and the Citizen,"
especially such chapters as those on the "Making of
Americans," "How the Government Aids the Citizen
in His Business Life," "Waste and Saving," "What the
Community Does for Those Who Cannot or Will Not
Contribute to Its Progress," has given valuable assistance
in leading to discussions which have direct bearing
upon daily life and work.</p>

<p>2. The following outline shows the treatment of the
second division of Civics:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="bk3">New York City: (1) City Government, (<i>a</i>) Officials,
Mayor, Commissioner, Borough President, Aldermen;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
(<i>b</i>) City Departments. (2) Citizenship, (<i>a</i>) Who are
citizens, (<i>b</i>) How to become a citizen, (<i>c</i>) Duties and
privileges of citizens, (<i>d</i>) Aliens. (3) Child Labor
Laws, (<i>a</i>) School attendance, (<i>b</i>) Working papers, how
obtained, (<i>c</i>) Hours for work. (4) Factory Laws for
girls over sixteen years old. (5) Sweatshop labor.
(6) Tenement House Laws. (7) Trade-Unions. (8)
Commerce and Industries of New York. (9) Philanthropies.</p></div>

<h3>Industries</h3>

<p>Aim: To furnish the worker with a background for
her trade and to help her to see her place in the working
world of today. 1. A generalized view is taken of the
main steps in the early progress of the race. 2. Textile
materials are discussed as to their values, their uses, their
cost, the processes of their manufacture, the comparison
of foreign and domestic goods, with reasons for the differences,
and the connected problems of arithmetic which
the students will meet. These subjects help the girl to
"get next" to what she is working with every day and
to arouse interest in her personal connection with the
subject. The English girl whose father was once employed
in a lace house in London brings mounted
specimens of that sort of handwork to the class; the
Hungarian brings hand-spun articles from her mother's
bridal outfit; the Italian presents a skein of raw silk
taken from the family's treasure box, and the girl from
Roumania brings an embroidered bed cover. The student
whose mother does not believe cotton ever grew on
bushes asks that she may verify her own statement by
taking home a real cotton ball. A Labor Museum
is being collected to give reality to the instruction, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
exhibits from it, which show the steps in the manufacturing
of the fabrics and of other familiar articles, are
put up in the classroom when needed. A bulletin board
provides for the numerous clippings brought by the
students or teachers.</p>

<h3>Arithmetic</h3>

<p>Aim: The fundamental aim of arithmetic is to give
the pupils working methods for the problems that occur
in trade practice. To make the correlation clear to the
girls, workroom methods of presentation and phraseology
and the customary materials are used. Sewing
and operating students make hems, tucks, and ruffles
to actual measurements; novelty girls cut and arrange
cards for samples in accordance with their workroom
demands; and millinery students work out the measurements
for hat frames as closely as varying styles permit.</p>

<p>With the fundamentals of trade problems established,
arithmetic is further developed along special lines of
trade to meet the demands of the business world. The
trained worker should not only be skilled in the manipulation
of tools and materials, but she should be able to
compute her own problems, such as estimates for garments,
how to cut materials economically, the cost of
one garment or article as related to the cost of many
of the same kind, the prices, and similar trade questions.
The ability to deal with these subjects adds materially
to the value of a skilled worker.</p>

<p>The central scheme of the course is to lead the pupil
to prompt and accurate mental calculation. This is
stimulated by frequent oral drills in trade problems and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
business problems involving short methods of computation.
The extent and progress of this work are regulated
by the ability of the class.</p>

<p>The following outlines show the adaptation of arithmetic
to the different trades:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class="bk3"><p><i>Operating</i>: (1) Cutting of gauges, (<i>a</i>) For hems,
(<i>b</i>) For tucks. (2) Tucking problems, (<i>a</i>) With gauges,
(<i>b</i>) As formal arithmetic problems. (3) Ruffling problems.
(4) Time problems, Department time schedules
as basis for the work. (5) Factory problems. (6) Income,
expenditure, savings. (7) Bills and receipts.
(8) Computation of quantity of material required for
garments, (<i>a</i>) By measuring garments, (<i>b</i>) By use of
patterns on cloth, (<i>c</i>) Economy of material. (9) Problems
based on above work. (10) Civic problems.</p>

<p><i>Sewing</i>: (1) Cutting of gauges, (<i>a</i>) For hems,
(<i>b</i>) For tucks. (2) Tucking problems. (3) Ruffling
problems. (4) Computation of quantity of material
required for garments, (<i>a</i>) By measuring garments,
(<i>b</i>) By use of patterns on cloth, (<i>c</i>) Economy of material.
(5) Problems based on above work. (6) Store

problems, (<i>a</i>) Quantity of material, (<i>b</i>) Price of materials,
(<i>c</i>) Economy of material. (3) Orders, (<i>a</i>) By

<h3>English</h3>

<p>Aim: 1. To facilitate oral and written expression.
2. To give practice in business forms: <i>Spelling</i>: (1)
Technical terms of each trade department; (2) Textiles
and other trade materials; (3) Ordinary business terms.
<i>Descriptions</i>: (1) Written work on materials used and
articles made in each department; (2) Outlining and
defining of department work. <i>Business Forms</i>: (1)
Letters of application; (2) Letters ordering goods;
(3) Telegrams, postal cards, etc.; (4) Writing of
advertisements.</p>

<p>In addition to practice in spelling and in the writing
of business forms, the work in English aims to be in
close correlation with the other subjects taught. As a
rule, the latter part of each recitation period is spent
by the pupils in writing upon the subject in hand. The
purpose is to obtain from them freedom of expression
after arousing interest in a subject, rather than to get
long compositions necessitating home study and probably
generating a dislike for written work. Attention is
called to paragraphing and emphasis is laid upon both
the form and the manner of writing, but form is made
subservient to thought. The interrelation of Art Department
helps the student to appreciate the need of good
form in the appearance of a written page.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="hd3">Physical Education Department</h3>

<p>The young wage-earner who goes into trade untrained
at fourteen years of age is greatly handicapped by her
physical condition. Either through ignorance or neglect
early symptoms of disease are disregarded, and it is not
until she finds herself out of employment as a result of
physical weakness that she realizes that good health is
the capital of the working girl.</p>

<p>Many of the girls who enter the school are found
to be suffering from poor vision; enlarged glands caused
by decayed teeth; poor nasal breathing as a result of
adenoid growths or enlarged tonsils; an&aelig;mia; skin eruptions;
slight asymmetries and poor posture. These
defects produce exaggerated nerve signs and poor
nutrition.</p>

<h3>Aim</h3>

<p>The work of the Physical Department is to correct
as many of these irregularities as possible and also to
train the student to a knowledge of her body and how
to care for it, that she may be able to stand the long
hours of confining work and be able to show efficient
results in her trade.</p>

<p>The following examination is required of each entering
student:</p>

<p><i>Physical Examination</i>: Beginning with the family
history, a complete record of all important events relating
to a student's physical life is taken. She is carefully
examined for asymmetry; curvature, incipient or well
defined; traces of tuberculosis; weakness of heart and
lungs; enlarged glands; skin diseases, or signs of nervous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
disorders. She is closely questioned as to all bodily
functions and a careful record is kept of irregularities.
Eyes, ears, teeth, nose, and throat are likewise examined.
Impressions of the feet are made in order to detect
weakness of the arch or flatfoot. Measurements of
height, weight, and the principal expansions are taken
for comparison with later records and for the purpose
of comparing with normal standard.</p>

<h3>Prescribed Treatment</h3>

<p>After the examination the girl is instructed as to
treatment, if any is needed. If perfectly normal she
will report for gymnastics three times a week. If any
asymmetry, curvature of the spine, heart disease, or
nervous disorders are discovered, she must report for
special corrective exercises at the school. In some cases
individual instruction is given for supplementing the
work at home. Cases demanding special apparatus and
individual attention have been treated in the Physical
Education Department of Teachers College, through the
kindness of the director, Dr. Thomas Denison Wood.
The girls so affected have thus the advantage of the
latest methods known to science. If any of the numerous
skin diseases are present which demand frequent
and regular attention, the student is assigned to a group
who go twice a week to a dispensary to receive electrical
or X-ray treatment. In cases of enlarged tonsils or
adenoids, the necessity for immediate operation is explained
and every effort made to gain the consent of
the parents. When permission is obtained the girl goes
to a neighboring hospital on Sunday evening, is operated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
upon on Monday, and returns home Tuesday. Each
student must have her eyes thoroughly examined by a
doctor selected at the Ophthalmic Dispensary. If glasses
are needed they are procured at the expense of the parent
or donated by an optician who is interested in the school.
Dispensary treatment is also necessary in cases of catarrh
of nose and throat. Teeth are carefully examined and
the girls directed to their own dentists, or to the Dental
Dispensary adjoining the school, where we are fortunate
enough to have a limited amount of work done free of
charge. Cases of asymmetry demanding braces, plaster
jackets, and operations have been treated at the Post-Graduate
Hospital. Tuberculosis cases in advanced
stages have been placed on the special boats in New
York Harbor or are sent to Tubercular Camps in the
country.</p>

<p>In sending girls to the hospitals and dispensaries the
aim is to place them in touch with institutions to which
they will have independent access after they leave the
Manhattan Trade School.</p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>

<p>The statistics below show the condition of 278 girls
when they registered at the school. The charts are
divided according to the departments entered. From
them can be seen the need of special care for the health
of the working girl.</p>

<p>A second examination of the same girls six months
later shows gain in weight, height, and general health;
125 had their teeth put in order; six were treated for
defective hearing; twenty had attended the Skin Clinic;
all had their eyes examined; eighty-six were fitted with
glasses. In twenty-five cases where the adenoids and
tonsils were removed the result was increase in weight,
better breathing and heart action, alertness of mind, and
a noticeable improvement in trade work. Where the
obstructions of nose and throat still remain there is loss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
in weight and diminished chest expansion and a generally
weakened condition. The extraction of decayed
teeth and the providing of well-fitting glasses have
diminished nervous irritability and the frequency of
headaches. Three cases of tuberculosis were sent to
camps. Seven cases of organic heart trouble were treated
by specialists; nineteen girls were given corrective exercises
at Teachers College; two were fitted with shoes
and braces; two were put into plaster jackets, one
for lateral rotary curvature and one for neuritis; and
one advanced case of chorea has been placed in the
hospital. Of the girls whose records are given in the
list it can be said that, with the exception of the cripples
and a few others needing simple operations, a year's
care shows that very few of them are in any way handicapped
by the effects of disease.</p>
